local text3 = [[A scientist, a robot, and a human/spider hybrid. Not really what one would expect a group of friends to look like. But when something very similar happens to each of them, they find themselves thrown into a world where the shadows are just a bit too dark, the air is just a bit too hostile, and everything, EVERYTHING, is against them. Follow Wilson, the Gentleman Scientist who is secretly a bit too quick to anger; WX-78, the Soulless Automaton, who isn't really as bad as he seems... or maybe he is; and Webber, the Indigestible, who is just a kid looking for someone who could accept him for him, as they face this cruel world. You can't trust anyone, and no one is safe. Anyone could be the next victim, although maybe... just maybe... they can find a few friends to aid them in their survival... The battle has begun.There was something near us. Something was dark. Something was wrong. What had happened last? We could not recall.“I wonder if he'll live...” a voice echoed. We strained our eyes to see who was talking. “Do you think he'll be okay?” “I doubt it,” said another voice. “That's a nasty wound.” “He can't die... I won't let him.” A third voice croaked, horror and fear edging its voice. Are they talking to us? Who are they?

 

Who are they?

 

We heard the sound of footsteps and sighing, then something cold pressed against our back. “I can't lose you,” the third voice whispered. “I just can't... you're the only friend I've ever had. Please... please don't leave us...”

 

Awareness began to spread to our limbs, and the dark curtain began to fade, and with that, the memories. We blinked our eyes open, the sunlight dazzling us for a few minutes. There are others, I thought. Are they the same people? No, it can't be... there's only two...

 

Our instincts came rushing back to us in a flood, and we jumped back from the others, who were also just stirring. The first one blinked in shock at the sight of us. He was taller than us, obviously an adult, with spiked black hair and confused gray eyes. We bared our teeth threateningly.

 

“Whoa,” he breathed, struggling to stand. “C.. can you speak?”

 

Does he think we're stupid? Is he trying to find weaknesses?

 

At least he speaks English.

 

“Yes,” I said slowly, not moving. He visibly relaxed. We turned our gaze to the third one. He was also sitting up, looking at both of us with disdain.

 

This one was a tan robot, obviously masculine and more our height, his 'face' was two identical holes for eyes, and a longer, thinner one underneath for a mouth. He did not look happy in the slightest bit, but perhaps that was just his appearance. He met our look with a fierce glare. “WHAT ARE YOU?” He spat.

 

We will fight if we have to.

 

But not yet.

 

“What are you?” I countered, looking him up and down. If he wants a fight, he'll get one. We've fought for years now, one more opponent is no different... even if he is slightly bigger than me.

 

“WHAT AM I?” He asked, tipping his chin arrogantly. “MODEL WX-78, FLESHLING.” He's aggressive.

 

“Webber,” I hissed back. We jerked our gaze to the other one.

 

“Wilson,” he replied quietly.

 

We let our shoulders relax, and fur lie flat again, straightened slightly, and put away our claws and snarl. If they aren't going to hurt us, then we need to seem harmless to them. “What are you doing here?”

 

“Do you know where we are?” The first one- Wilson- asked hopefully, examining our spiderlike appearance.

 

“No. Do you?”

 

He shook his head, and we sighed. Trust no one, isn't that what our life has taught us?

 

Maybe we need to trust someone?

 

No. I thought stubbornly. We can rely on ourself. But looking at these other two... these other two in the same predicament as us. We looked at Wilson. He looks trustworthy, but... our gaze met WX-78's. Not so sure about him...

 

Were they the ones talking to us? We instinctively ran our hand over our neck and stomach, the most likely places for a fatal wound, but there was nothing but smooth skin and old scars beneath our fur.

 

WX let out a huff of scorn, before walking away.

 

“Hey!” I exclaimed, moving to catch him. “Where are you going?”

 

Wilson caught our shoulder. “Don't bother. I know his type. He'll come back if he wants to, but no use forcing him to stay with us.” He cocked his head and smiled.

 

We weren't sure exactly what to say. Not only were we not used to being spoken to directly in such tones, but we hadn't been smiled at in ages. “Us?” I repeated. “You mean you're staying?”

 

He looked confused. “Why wouldn't I? It'd be better if we stick together, right?”

 

“Y-you mean you aren't afraid of us?” I couldn't help blurting out.

 

“Afraid,” he echoed. “Just out of curiosity's sake... how old are you? Surely you couldn't survive on your own for long.”

 

 

“Seven,” I answered quietly. “And we can... we have before.”

 

He laughed. “Okay, how about I probably can't survive on my own for long.”

 

“You never have?”

 

“I lived alone,” he replied. “Not... alone alone though.”

 

“Are you suggesting it's only us?” I asked in horror.

 

“Us and... WX-78? Was that his name?”
 

“Yeah, 'think so.” We cocked our head. “You think we're alone, though? No one else?” We realized too late how small our voice sounded. We were scared.

 

We were scared.

 

We're not, a tiny voice in our mind whispered. We're not scared. Being scared is for cowards, and so is relying on others. We pushed it back as Wilson seemed to struggle finding words.

 

“We can only assume we are alone until we find other people here,” he pointed out gently, then nodded to the area around us. We realized for the first time that we were in a small forest clearing. We listened hard for distant birdsong to greet us, but it was silent. “Besides, it's getting dark.” Our gaze snapped up to the darkening sky. Already!? “We should just... set up camp for the night, and figure out what we're going to do in the morning. A chill wind brushed the leaves above us, making us shiver. A tang of frost was carried on the breeze, but we couldn't tell if it was turning cold or it had been colder and was warming up.

 

“Yeah.”

 

…

 

“Why? Why did you do this?” a voice whimpered nearby, and it took us a second to realize it was our voice.

 

“I had no choice,” someone else replied. We felt grief welling up in our chest. “You know, w-we fought a lot before. And I'm sorry. I regret it. I regret all of it... but I don't regret this decision.” What decision! Our mind cried. Who are we talking to and why!?

 

It didn't last long though, because then we were crouching over... something? Darkness still pressed around us, but ragged breathing ruffled our hand fur. “No... No... th-this can't be happening.” This time, our voice sounded ever so slightly different. “We can't lose you too. Can you even hear us? Please... we're sorry.”

 

We jerked awake, heart pounding, early sunlight momentarily blinding us. The robot had apparently returned, and sat nearby, leaning against a tree at the edge of the clearing with an odd black book leaning up against a sapling beside him. He did not acknowledge our presence. Our dream weighed heavily on our mind, but the details had already faded. Wilson was looking at us, confusion in his gray eyes. “Are... you okay?”

 

“We're fine,” I told him.

 

Suddenly, the fur on the back of our neck stood on end, and we saw that WX had looked up at us, his gaze dark with pure hatred. We narrowed our eyes at him. If you want to hate us, fine. We'll hate you too.What did I do to deserve this? I silently wondered, fixating the other two with looks of hatred. Humans! I hissed to myself. I'm sitting next to two pathetic humans. Oh, how disappointed you'd be in me... I tried to push the last thought away. I reached instinctively for the book at my side, reassuring myself with its presence. There was something odd about the smooth black leather of the cover, like it was too pristine, too well kept to have just been abandoned. Sure, there was someone next to it, but the clean white bones of the skeleton, it's face locked in an eternal scream of terror, suggested they had been dead a very long time. Seeing the skeleton filled me with a sort of dark satisfaction. Another part of me wished that that was one of these fleshlings I was stuck with.

 

I realized too late that while I had been deep in thought, my glare had been situated on the spider who introduced himself as Webber. He was looking at me back, his lip curled in a snarl and fur bristling. I met his glower evenly, and he looked away first. Without looking away, I stroked the book's cover once more. A shock seemed to zap my finger as I touched the red symbol in the center of the book, and I was thrown into a torrent of what felt like memories, but I could not recall them ever happening. A grief-stricken wail that pierced the air, the rushing sound of footsteps, the clanking of my own self falling to the ground. I panicked for just a moment, before reminding myself where I was. I am safe. I reminded myself sharply. I am safe. Gradually, the feeling ebbed away, and I suddenly felt very weak. I slid down the bark of the tree, holding my head until I was in a sitting position. I felt like I could hardly stand. I recognized that voice, I thought in horror. I shook the feeling away, and when I had finally controlled myself, I noticed that Webber had looked at me again, his gaze mocking.

 

Wilson appeared to have noticed the look, too, because he looked faintly concerned and said something to the spider. It was too far for me to hear, but by the way he nodded and stood up, I could only assume that they were going somewhere. Good, I thought. I can be alone now. I stood, trying to keep my knees from buckling again. I grabbed the book again, my grip shaky. The symbol was too red, and pulsing oddly. I tried to drop it, but failed.

 

Suddenly, I was on the ground, panic setting in. I looked up sharply, only to see that Webber was standing over me, his whiskers twitching with amusement. “You were so out of it,” he sneered. Angrily, I kicked his legs out from under him, causing him to nearly fall on top of me with a squeak of protest, then I kicked him onto his back.

 

“You two! Quit fighting!” Wilson demanded. I turned indignantly to him.

 

“HE STARTED IT!” I protested.

 

“What are you, four? Grow up.” Despite the sharp words, there was an underlying gentleness to his voice, almost as though he were speaking to children. I nearly sniped back at him, but Webber was nodding seriously at me.

 

“We should listen to him.” There was still a mocking note in his voice. “After all, he is an adult.” However, as he turned his gaze to Wilson, he eyed him with a sort of desperate hunger. I knew that look. He was wanting approval. Not knowing nor caring if he received it, I stood up and brushed the dirt off of my knees and, my fingers trembling, picked up the book once more. “What's that?” Webber asked, hopping up to look at it himself. I snatched it away with a glare.

 

“NOTHING,” I snapped.

 

“It... looks like something,” he ventured, trying to pull my arm down to look at it.

 

I promptly replied by smacking him in the back of the head with it.

 

He yelped at the sudden pain which I used to push him down, stalking to the other side of the clearing with my chin tipped upwards as Wilson helped him to his feet. Two sets of eyes burned into my back- one confused and concerned, the other enraged beyond compare. Without a word and before the spider could do anything in retaliation, I pushed my way out of the clearing, still holding the book.

 

Wilson's POV

 

“We're gonna rip that little jerk limb from limb when we get our hands on him!” Webber roared, trying to struggle away from my vice grip on his arm.

 

“No one's ripping anyone limb from limb,” I informed him patiently, trying to hide my teeth grinding in frustration. To be honest, when he first said his age, I was shocked and confused. He was a kid. A kid! First of all, what in the world was he doing in a place like this, and why was he so intent on violently dismembering someone he literally just met. He struggled, of course, but he soon gave up, his bottom lip twitching in a barely suppressed snarl.

 

“Fine,” he muttered.

 

I narrowed my eyes at him. “That means no fighting at all.”

 

He stared at me for a few seconds, his mouth agape as though I had just told him to jump off of a cliff. “He hit us,” he reminded me sharply, rubbing the back of his head for emphasis.

 

“It's not that bad,” I pointed out lightly. “It could've been worse.” After all, a human-sized hunk of metal and gears could probably have done much worse had he wanted to. Something kept him back though... I know the look of someone who hates someone else, that's definitely what I have on my hands here... but why would WX-78 just whack him instead of going full-blown murder on him? I need to look into that later. For now, I need to figure out how I going to keep these two in line without taking suicidal risks. I wasn't very fond of the idea of going against a human-sized hunk of metal and gears either, and even without looking I could tell the spider boy's fangs could do some serious damage should he want to hurt me.

 

He tore his arm away from my grip and sat grumpily down where he stood in a criss-cross applesauce manner and his arms folded over his chest. “He's still a jerk,” he growled.

 

I sighed. I knew I had my hands full with these two, but tried to stay neutral. To be honest, I didn't particularly want to take sides- WX was being a jerk but Webber was being violent, they both needed to calm down. “I'll go find WX,” I sighed again.

 

He jumped up again, glaring at me now. “You're going to find him?”

 

“We're in this together,” I replied.

 

“We don't want to deal with him!”

 

“Then leave.”

 

That shut him up real quick, resigning to mumbling under his breath instead of protesting aloud. I don't think he realizes that we need each other... maybe they will mellow out after awhile.

 

The look of pure hatred that Webber was shooting the area where WX disappeared said otherwise. Shaking my head, I went off in search of the irritable bot. Much to my surprise, Webber followed me. Whether that was to actually find him or to find a way to hurt him was beyond me. Luckily, being a very heavy robot, he made quite the trail through the brush. It cleared out into a grassland with several clear-water ponds. The clearing was filled with frogs- not like the frogs from my world, where they were only the size of your fist at most, these frogs were enormous. One was so big it was up to my knee's length. Webber did not seemed fazed in the slightest of the giant creatures, he just casually weaved among them while I looked on in shock. How in the world was the spider so confident? Surely whatever part of the world he came from, he never saw frogs this big.

 

“What are you?” I blurted, causing him to stop completely with his foot in the air. I saw him take a deep breath, then turn to me. He did not look happy. “Are you actually a spider?”

 

“Partially,” he mumbled, turning back to the ponds without another word. I opened my mouth to ask his meaning, then realized that he'd probably add me to his hitlist if I wasn't already on it. How is that possible? Inbreeding? I mean... is it possible for a spider to breed with a human? Or... he sure looks like a human under all that fur. My mind swirled with possibilities of what the strange spider-child might be. I was still in a daze when I managed to force my shocked body to move, walking in the footsteps he took. The look on his face when I asked him what he was.... was that sadness? Anger that I had asked such a question? Regret? Of course. Realization suddenly dawned on me. If my theories are correct in assuming he is half human, half spider, who would want to be around him? People would be terrified of him because he looks like a spider, and spiders... well, spiders are way too small to worry about. So how in the world does he exist because spiders are very small creatures that cannot breed with a human! Maybe he's some sort of lab experiment. That probably makes the most sense. An experiment on what would happen if they mixed a spider and human's DNA?

 

I was so deep in thought, it wasn't until Webber grabbed the collar of my shirt to keep me from falling into one of the frog ponds that I realized I had been in the danger of doing so in the first place. I took a few steps back, staring at it. I turned to thank him only to realize that he had already started moving again, completely ignoring that I even existed. Confused, I jogged a bit to catch up to him. “You alright?” I asked.

 

“No.”

 

I was taken aback for a second at his bluntness. “What's wrong.”

 

 

“Nothing. I don't like talking about it, that's all.”

 

I felt guilty for my earlier questioning.

 

“It's nothing against you, you seem like a good person.” His whiskers twitched. “It's just... a touchy subject, I guess.”

 

“Your... past?”

 

He nodded, not meeting my gaze. Suddenly, he picked up his pace. “WX!” He called, less hatred in his voice compared to earlier, surprising me. Then my blood froze. The robot had apparently collapsed, the book he had been obsessing over a few paces away. My first instinct was to try to shake him awake, but of course, Webber had other ideas. With a satisfied smile, he kicked the robot as hard as he could in the chest.

 

It seemed to hurt Webber more than it hurt WX, but it was still enough to rouse him. While the first hopped on one foot, grimacing in pain, the latter blinked open his 'eyes'. With a soft groan, he pulled himself to his feet, albeit wobbly on his feet. “What happened to you?” I asked, but he didn't seem to realize that I was standing there.

 

Under his breath, he quietly murmured “I'M SORRY.”

 

I found my gaze drifting to the black book at his side. He followed it and slowly picked it up. Some part of my mind knew that that book was what caused him to act oddly. Without knowing why, I shivered. What is that book? It's... unreal... It's... dangerous.The next morning brought new adventure. Wilson had decided to stay back at where our makeshift base was gradually showing up, and WX had stayed with him. Before we left, we heard them arguing about the book.

 

“WX! Come on! Just let me look at it!”

 

The robot had arrogantly turned away, tipping his chin upwards like he always did. “NEVER! YOUR PUNY FLESHLING MIND COULD NEVER COMPREHEND WHAT LAYS INSIDE OF IT!”

 

“That's why I want to look at it! So I can understand what it mean- come on!”

 

 

“YOU'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND IT!” And with those last words, he got up once more- as customary for him nowadays whenever he started an argument- and stalked out of the clearing- at least not the same way as last time. We caught Wilson muttering under his breath. He let out a sigh that hinted that he was trying very hard not to say or do something but his patience was running out.

 

We said nothing, just calmly stood and brushed the dirt off of our knees. Hunger was beginning to tug at our senses. So far, we had noticed the other two foraging for berries and such, but we craved meat. We hadn't even attempted to get any sort of food ourself. This was not starvation. We had felt starvation before. This was a simple hunger. Still didn't mean that it was starting to gnaw at us. We nodded once to the scientist, then prepared to set off as well, in the direction opposite of the frog ponds. Day three. Had it already been three days since we arrived? The first night was probably the worst for all of us. It had been uncomfortably dark around our campfire, and when we tried once to step out into the night, we could've sworn we heard someone whisper our name in our ear. Ever since then, we had decided to never go into the darkness again.

 

Shaking away these thoughts, we decided that maybe we could get something productive done and scout a bit. Whether or not we would keep moving or stay at our fire was beyond us. We stopped for a moment and let the smells of the forest smother our senses. Up ahead, the sun was shining cheerfully, bathing the woods in a soft golden glow and speckling the ground with rays of light. After a moment of concentrating, our mind latched onto what we were searching for and run ahead on light feet. The forest began to thin out before we broke out into plain, golden grasses as far as the eye could see. Our eyes caught on the one thing we wanted to see. Large, brown-furred rabbits. Whiskers twitching in excitement, we followed the creatures' movements. Hunting was never our forte, but something like rabbits should not be a problem. They wouldn't know what hit them. We looked around for a moment, looking for something sharp to hunt with. That'll do! There was a thick, sharp rock on the ground a few paces away. We grabbed it and moved slowly over to one of the rabbit burrows, situation ourself between it and the rabbit that nibbled mindless on the grass nearby. Something must have spooked it though, because it paused and rose onto its hind legs, sniffing the air cautiously. With a sudden scream that made us jump, it fled backwards and right into us. We quickly killed the beast with a stab to the throat with the rock, then lifted it to examine it. It was big, but we knew from experience that not much of that was edible meat. At the moment, however, we did not care. We grinned. At least we knew that we had a supply of meat.

 

 

When we got back to camp, we saw Wilson's eyes widen at the rabbit in our hands. “Where did you find that?” He asked.

 

“There's a grassland over there that has a bunch of these,” I answered calmly. “They're really not hard to hunt at all. They're pretty dumb. Can't survive off berries forever.”

 

He nodded, a smile spreading across his face. “Do you know how to prepare meat?”

 

We nodded. “Our father used to keep goats. He taught us how.”

 

He let out a nervous chuckle. “Good, because I don't know how to.”

 

We snickered. “We can teach you how?”

 

He was silent for a few seconds. “Why do you talk like that...?” He asked tentatively.

 

We paused for a second. “Like what?”

 

“Well... you say 'we' instead of 'I'... why?”

 

We wondered for a moment how to explain without teasing old memories or breaking his mind. “When we were five, we were eaten by a spider. Now, we think together.” That was a little too far, because our chest ached for just a second after saying that.

 

“R-really? You know...” he chuckled again. “It's not scientifically possible for a spider to be of human-eating size...” he clamped his mouth shut as we felt the old feeling stir up again.

 

With a forced smile, we shrugged. “Nothing around here is scientifically possible. You just haven't seen much of it yet.” He seemed to turn a shade paler at the ominous words, but before he could start up the questioning again we turned back to the grassland. “We'll go hunting again, and we can show you how to prepare live animals tonight, 'kay?”

 

“O-okay.”

 

By the time we got to the grassland again, we were aware that we weren't the only ones to have discovered it, and it just so happened that the other one to have found it was WX, and he was intent on his own hunt. He wasn't fast like us though, he was heavy and clumsy. We grabbed the flint from earlier, grinning madly as it ran right into us. We lunged forward and stabbed it in its throat, feeling it go limp.

 

The robot stomped his foot. “HEY!” He protested. “THAT WAS MINE!”

 

“Yours?” I barked a laugh. “Should've gotten it first, then.” We noticed a tension in his limbs that suggested he was holding back a lot of anger. Our grin only widened, which apparently he took as further aggression.

 

“ARE YOU TRYING TO START SOMETHING?” He growled under his breath.

 

Were we trying to start something? Had we gotten so used to fighting that that was we could do now? “Maaaaaybe?” As we met his glare evenly, realization hit us like a rock. This was not about the rabbit. He hated us. Being stuck with us for even three days was enough to round up enough hatred for him to hate us. This word was enough provocation, because next thing we knew, we were on the ground and our left cheek burned like fire. The pain disappeared in an instant to be replaced with fury. Back on our feet in an instant, we tackled him to the ground. Shock flared in his 'eyes' as though he did not expect us to be able to retaliate so quickly. We weren't used to fighting machines, but he acted so natural it was easier than we expected. He pushed us off as though we were a leaf and instantly took advantage of our surprise to use his weight to pin us down and put what felt like all of his strength to punch all out at our face. The biggest problem with this one that we were not used to...

 

He. Was. Heavy. When we finally managed to push him off, we were sure our jaw had been broken and maybe some of our ribs just from his weight. The second we were back on our feet again, we launched ourself at him, causing both of us to tumble down back towards the forest, which was located down a slope. The breath was suddenly knocked out of our chest as we were rammed into the trunk of a thick pine tree. WX jumped back in an instant even though we were temporarily paralyzed in shock and our stomach and throat were wide open.

 

The ground was shaking, or at least, it felt like it was shaking. We didn't realize that we had landed on a half-buried root until it was yanked out from under us. Reality crashed over us like a wave as soon as we saw the trees branches morph into limbs.

 

The tree was alive.

 

Without the breath in our lungs, we could not run until we could get it back, and the paralysis lasted until, without warning, WX grabbed our arm and started to run, apparently trying to get us away from the beast even though this very same robot was trying to kill us just seconds before. He looked over his shoulder at us, and we noticed pure terror dancing in his gaze. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU TRYING TO GET US BOTH KILLED? RUN!”

 

 

“What is that thing!?”

 

“SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH! SPLIT UP!” The shouted direction took a second for us to process, but by the time we figured out what he said he had taken off in a separate direction. Hoping his plan would work, we quickly changed direction to run in the opposite direction he had. A frustrated roar followed by heavy stomping in our direction told us it was giving chase, and we had to scrabble over thick roots and push away trailing branches just to keep somewhat of a lead on it. Before we even knew what was happening, the beast had gained on us and the breath was driven once more from our lungs as it swiped at us, not quite impaling us but sending us crashing into a tree painfully. Luckily, this one did not turn to attack as well. It wasn't much for keeping our spirits up. We lay still, unsure if we even could get up again, and the beast stayed put for a good hour, before aiming one last blow at where we stood, forcing out a silent wail of agony as white hot pain ripped through our legs, then stomped off again with grunts of satisfaction. It must've thought we were dead... Or are we dead? Wow, we've been here a grand total of three days and already dead. Good job, Webber. Great surviving skills!

 

Something must have happened after that. We must have passed out or something, because next thing we were conscious of was being on some sort of grass bed. Our jaw stung like fury, and the pain in our legs was almost unbearable. But what mattered was that we were alive, and once again, at camp. We wondered for just a few moments who brought us back, but the train of thought was completely derailed as we attempted to say something to the figure by the fire- most likely Wilson- and the pain in our jaw struck back with a renewed strength. We must have been able to do something to alert Wilson of being awake once more, because he turned around and his steady expression melted into relief. “You're awake!” he breathed. “You're actually awake! I would've thought that you would've been out out for much longer than that...” he tapped his chin thoughtfully. “I might have to look into that, but thank goodness you're alright. No- don't try to talk,” he sputtered as we braced ourself against the torture of moving our jaw to speak. “It might make it worse.”

 

Being unable to speak, we raised an eyebrow, flinching.

 

“Your jaw is severely bruised. I can't tell if it's broken until the swelling's gone down. Your legs, however, appear to have been shattered.” He blinked, then narrowed his eyes. “Don't tell me you two fought. Ah, I can tell by the look on your face you're still confused. You see, after WX told me what happened, I asked about you. He said he didn't know nor care- as to be expected- but at least had the decency to show me where you two had been attacked. The-uh- broken tree limbs and felled trees told me the rest.”

 

“What was that thing?” I forced, causing Wilson to flinch and look even more worried.

 

“The tree guard?” He asked, and we nodded. “It's-well-a tree guard. Pretty nasty creature, I can't tell you anything about it you didn't learn from being chased by it like that.”

 

“How...?”

 

“How... how do I know what it's called?” He guessed, and grinned madly as he revealed the black book, the very book WX had been trying to keep him from getting to, under his arm. “It has all the mysteries of this place... all the creatures, all the fauna, all the... victims...”

 

“Victims?”

 

“Stop that,” he demanded. “You're making it worse on both of us. But yes, the victims. Everyone that... he... has tricked.”

 

Maxwell. The name flared in our mind, burning the searing picture into our thoughts. Was that his name? The man who talked to us...?

 

“Some of them... some of them have these red 'M's over them... I don't know what they mean... I'm not sure I want to know what they mean. And yes, we have the honor of being one of those. That would've been your next question, wouldn't it have been?”

 

Most likely.

 

The next one after that, though, would have been there's MORE!? We're not alone!?

 

“And... you still look like you have questions...”

 

How is anyone that good at reading body language?

 

 

“Let me guess, where's WX?”

 

...No...

 

He shrugged. “He's off doing.... robot things. I don't really know what he does when he's not trying to start something other than indirectly starting something, so I can't really answer that question.” His eyes softened. “You must still be exhausted from that experience. I can't say I blame you. Tell you what,” he added with a hint of adventurous excitement in his voice. “I found a little plain just full of bees not too far from here, and from what I've learned of survival, honey would be very useful for you. Not to mention we might be able to get that arm wound fixed up.” Arm wound? We hadn't noticed until now, but a gash had been ripped open in between our wrist and elbow. “Just noticing it now? Good, I was worried that you were having problems with that as well as the jaw and leg thing. I guess what they say about your body focusing on the worst wound is true,” he concluded. “You get some rest. I think I can handle WX for just a few days. You need to sleep to heal yourself.”

 

We almost protested about being useless but we cut ourself off as we remembered his earlier reaction to speaking at all. And besides... we were feeling awfully sleepy... “You feeling better?” I asked Webber, who had recently woken up and was sitting up, but looked perfectly miserable. “So-um- I don't think your jaw's broken, just fractured... can you speak?”

 

“Sounds like a familiar question,” he mumbled. “But yeah, better than we could yesterday anyway. Will we be able to walk again?”

 

“Should be... I don't see why not, though you'd have to take it easy for awhile. You won't be able to for a few weeks.... broken bones don't just heal over night.”

 

His eyes widened. “You're telling us we won't be able to do anything for weeks- Wilson!” His voice turned whiny when he exclaimed my name, and I was taken slightly aback. He was threatening to tear WX limb from limb just a couple of days ago... and now he's kind of showing his kid side!

 

“Yes,” I replied firmly. He sighed heavily, cringing, and I raised an eyebrow. I hadn't gathered any honey yet for his arm, but surely that wasn't what hurt this time. “What's wrong?”

 

“You've been trying to figure out what happened, haven't ch'a?”

 

I was shocked into silence. Was I really that predictable? Then again, I assumed I probably freaked him out yesterday when I was guessing his questions, but they were questions anyone would have- or at least I assumed so. Behind me, I sensed WX flinching.

 

“Isn't it obvious?” He adopted a wry look. “Come on, guess.”

 

“You two got into a fight about something stupid.”

 

“He started it,” the spider flashed, admitting I had guessed right without an ounce of guilt or shock. “He hit us.”

 

“YOU PROVOKED ME!” The robot protested, shoving me aside to glare at Webber.

 

“Stop it!” I stomped my foot. “I am sick of you two always fighting! I don't care who started it, I don't care who hit who first. All I know for certain is that Webber is one of us, WX, and he is hurt.” As I turned to glare WX down, I saw in the corner of my eye that Webber had tried to hiss something in reply, but the quick movement must have hurt because he snapped his mouth shut, holding one hand over where the break would have been and resorted to just glowering.

 

WX met my gaze evenly, a hint of challenge in his 'eyes'. At first, I had thought that WX had started it after all, given the way he hit the spider without hesitation because of his curiosity over the book, but now I realized just the look he was giving me was enough to instantly make anyone hostile, and it was becoming more and more likely to me that Webber had been the one to throw the first punch. “HE'S HURT BECAUSE OF HIS OWN STUPIDITY,” WX huffed. “I LACK THE EMPHATHY MODULE TO FEEL BAD FOR THE IGNORANT.”

 

“If you're so amazing actually fight us this time and don't cower at the first sight of danger!”

 

He took a step forward, hand raised in readiness to take him up on the offer. “You know what?” My patience finally snapping, I smacked his hand down and wrapped my leg around his, yanking his feet out from under him, and pushed him to the ground. He landed with a dull thump, and Webber's eyes stretched wide in admiration.

 

“Wow!” He breathed. “We wish we could do that!”

 

“I said stop it. Which means you two stop fighting! WX, come with me.”

 

“NO!” He jumped to his feet, 'eyes' burning with anger. “I'M NOT BEING STUCK WITH A MEATSACK.”

 

“Are you saying you'd rather be stuck with Webber? Because- you know what, that sounds like a great idea. Think of it as a team building exercise. Step one: You two stay here without killing each other. Step two: You two find a way to keep yourselves from killing each other. Done!”

 

Despite my loss of patience, I could've died laughing by the identical looks of pure rage and shock that the two gave me.

 

“While you two are learning how to be friends, I'm going to be gathering honey for Webber's wound. You know, doing something productive? Wh-What is so funny?” A wide grin had been spreading across the spider's face. “What?”
 

“You're,” he paused, snickering. “You're literally just gonna leave and pretend we aren't gonna try to hurt each other physically and/or mentally?”

 

“I'm going to leave and hope you two aren't gonna try to hurt each other physically and/or mentally.” I scowled at him. “Come on! You two have known each other for four days. Four days for Pete's sake, that isn't enough to hate each other the way you two do!”

 

“OH, HOW... ADORABLE,” WX sneered. “YOU HAVE BEEN SO SHELTERED, HAVEN'T YOU? FIRST TIME SEEING THE OUTSIDE WORLD, WILSON? OR ARE YOU JUST DULL?”

 

I took a deep breath. “WX, I'm not going to give you the pleasure of starting something-”

 

“SCARED, SCIENTIST?”

 

“No, I just don't fight to solve my problems.”

 

“AH, WE HAVE A COWARD THEN?”
 

“Says the one who ran as soon as he saw the treeguard!” Webber snapped.

 

I rubbed my temples.

 

“I MIGHT HAVE SAVED YOUR LIFE!” Actual shock reverberated in his voice, and I perked at the new information.

 

“What!?”

 

The spider looked faintly lost, as though he either did not realize he had did so or he just remembered that he did.

 

“SHOULD'VE GUESSED WE WOULD HAVE LEFT OUT THAT DETAIL. AFTERALL, WHAT DOES THAT MAKE THE EVER-SO-BRAVE-WEBBER IF WILSON KNEW HE COMPLETELY FROZE UP.” He tipped his chin. “I HAD TO PRACTICALLY DRAG HIM AWAY TO KEEP IT FROM DOING EVEN WORSE.”

 

Webber lowered his gaze, muttering under his breath.

 

“What?”

 

“Maybe we didn't want you to save our life,” he growled before lying back down and turning his back on us.

 

I was completely lost for words. Had he really just said he wanted to die? Or was he just feeling like he wanted to because of the amount of pain he was in? I couldn't help him more than I already had- minus the wound on his arm- and the way he winced when he sighed earlier lead me to believe that damage had been done to his ribs also, so maybe...?

 

I noticed that WX had a similar look of shock and even a bit of concern, but as soon as I looked at him he quickly covered it up with a sneer, so I wasn't even sure if I had actually seen it or not. “AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE GOING SOMEWHERE?” He asked me impatiently.

 

I found myself opening and closing my mouth a few times, trying to form words. He let out a slightly annoyed huff and turned back to the fire we had tried to keep alive. All of the wood had burned away, leaving just a pile of ash and charcoal in its wake, and the breath suddenly rushed out of my lungs in a heavy sigh. He brushed the ashes away and lifted his axe over his shoulder. The axe was another thing that had just appeared randomly- WX had found it and had refused to explain its origins, but it had made better fires than the meager pickings of grass and twigs we had been living off of until then.

 

Had I not heard the tremor of terror quivering in the spider's voice when he told me about the voice that whispered to him in the darkness, I would've believed it was just a figment of his young, childlike mind, and we wouldn't have resorted to burning small amounts of grasses and twigs to keep the darkness away when we couldn't find the proper wood we needed. However useful WX's axe was- however- it unsettled me to know we had no clue how he found it. Did he find someone already dead? Did he raid someone's camp? Did he kill someone?

 

Any of the possibilities were likely knowing him.

 

As the robot delved into the forest for wood, I took a few moments before going out myself to check on Webber's wounds. He had fallen asleep again, luckily, so I was able to check him for wounds other than his arm, jaw and legs, namely his ribs. They didn't look broken... perhaps just fractures like his jaw, or even just bruised. I frowned again at his arm. He might not feel it compared to the more intense pain that must have been in his broken bones, but that didn't stop it from becoming deadly should it get infected. To be honest, that was my biggest priority. I reached out to check when he stiffened before I even touched his chest. I paused, my hand in midair. His teeth were bared and his hands were clenched around his grass bed. Confusion gave way to fear for the child, and I shook him fiercely, trying to wake him up. His eyes snapped open and he yelped, pushing me away. “Watch it!”

 

“What... was that!?” I demanded.

 

“What was what?” His voice was turning sleepy again.

 

I frowned a bit. “Night terrors?”

 

“Nightmares,” he replied instantly, sighing as he tried to relax. To be honest, I wasn't sure what startled him more. The nightmare or me waking him up. “Don't worry yourself about it... it's... just one of the perks of being us.” Another heavy sigh that melted into a soft snore, and I wondered for just a moment if he would even recall that this had happened. I lightly patted the boy's furry shoulder.

 

“We'll get you all fixed up, Webber,” I murmured to him. “WX and I... he cares too, trust me. I can tell. You'll be better in no time.”

 

Bees, for the most part, are very protective creatures, namely over their home and honey. Luckily, they were also big, heavy, and slow animals, making it pathetically easy to just outrun them. This made the hard part not not getting injured by them, but finding a way to contain honey. It was too easy to take simple things like jars for granted, but when you found yourself without one, it suddenly became a distant, pleasant thought. I found myself having to carry the honeycomb with my bare hands, causing the oozing yellow liquid to drip through my partially spread fingers and making my shirt sticky with honey.

 

By the time I got back, I was surprised beyond words to find that the robot had actually reappeared shortly before I had gotten back, and currently had his back to a tree trunk, a pile of odd shaped tree nuts to the right of him, to the left of him was a collection of intricately carved figurines. “What are those?”

 

“BIRCHNUTS.”

 

I frowned, realizing I should have known that. After all, it wasn't exactly a secret that I had snatched the book from him. I should've remembered it from the reading, but I must have dozed off before getting to information about them. “New trees?”
 

He nodded, squinting at another birchnut he held in one hand. The outer coating had been sliced off clearly to reveal a whitish green inside. He used the axe he held to chip a few slices of it off. Webber was conscious again, though he still appeared drowsy. His eyelids drooped as he watched WX blankly.

 

“...what are you doing?”
 

He blinked up at me, a twinge of annoyance showing through. “SOMETHING,” he muttered, turning back to his work. I picked up one of the carved birchnuts by his side. It was incredibly well-made and unmistakably a Chess piece- a rook to be more specific.

 

“...you're carving Chess pieces?”
 

“YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GET BORED,” he replied without looking back up.

 

I cringed. I remembered last time I got bored, and it did not end well. Shaking the thought away, I glanced at Webber. “What are you doing?”

 

“Watching,” he mumbled. “Is that honey?” I nodded and he let out a relieved sigh. “Thank goodness. Our arm was really beginning to hurt.” I raised my brow.

 

“Can I check it...?”

 

“Please do.” He grimaced. “We didn't feel it much at first, but it aches now. Where did you get so good at doctoring?” He asked, lifting his arm so show me the gash.

 

“My father was a doctor,” I replied absentmindedly. “He crammed knowledge at me since I was little. That's actually what got me into being a scientist. Medical science was fascinating.”

 

“Guess it's a good thing he did so. We have no clue where we would be if you were as clueless as us.” I shook my head slowly, letting out a flustered noise. “Is it that bad?”
 

“Well... it's infected. Just as I was afraid of. Hopefully the honey will help.”

 

“IS IT LETHAL?” I jumped out of my skin as WX piped up behind me. Is he concerned?

 

“No, not if I can get it treated quick enough,” I told him without looking back. “If I'm gonna fix this, I'll have to clean it up a bit. Is that okay? It'll hurt, but it'll feel better in the long run.”

 

Webber nodded.

 

“I'll be right back. WX, do you have any extra birchnuts? Any large ones?”

 

“INDEED.” He dragged his backpack- another thing he appeared with without explanation- closer to him and opened it up, revealing that it was nearly full of the large seeds, then promptly produced two tree nuts.

 

“Thank you.” I snatched up a piece of flint and made my way towards where the frog ponds were. By this time, dusk was beginning to fall. On the way, I took the time to carefully carve out the inside of the tree nuts. Much to my relief, no frogs were out of the ponds. I filled the makeshift cups then returned to camp to boil the water and hopefully kill whatever toxins lived in it. Upon returning to base, I noted that WX had apparently finished his Chess carvings, and was building up the fire, while Webber gazed into the dancing flames, his muscles stiff as though preparing for the worst. They both looked up as I rushed into the clearing, and WX quickly handed me a few large leaves, but refused to meet my gaze as though he was embarrassed. Amusement bubbled up inside of me at his gesture, but I had to admit it was quite kind of him- a complete change from how he was the day before.

 

The sun had gone down by the time I determined the water was safe. Using the leaves WX gave me, I cleaned Webber's wound in the firelight. The spider had his eyes shut tightly and his jaws clenched, but luckily did not flinch as I expected him to. “Are you done?” He asked through gritted teeth as I fixed the poultice over the gash.

 

“Yeah, that's it.”

 

He visibly relaxed and breathed out in relief. “It feels so much better... thank you Wilson.”

 

“No problem. It just needed some proper care.”

 

He smiled, then yawned, causing me to yawn as well.

 

“FLESHLINGS NEED THEIR SLEEP,” WX advised, a hint of sneer back in his voice.

 

I mentally chortled. Well, he's back I guess. Not sure exactly what that was about...although... that was an awfully non-sinister thing he said. Maybe he just likes to pretend he's a jerk. Maybe he's really nice on the inside.

 

I nearly burst out laughing at this thought. Some part of me highly doubted that was the case. I nodded sleepily, then lay down by the fire. It felt like it had been awhile since I had slept.. Tomorrow I'll go explore a bit.... maybe find that birchnut forest WX was talking about.

 

I could leave them alone just for a little bit...

 

Right? Come on spider. Just one more stupid move. One more stupid move and you'll be dead. Victory will finally be mine. Just you wait. I see where you are looking... yes... yes fall into my trap!

 

Webber looked up at me with a smug grin as though he realized what I was about to do. He then ruined my plan entirely by looking elsewhere and sliding his bishop across the board that had been drawn in the dirt. “We believe that is a check?” He asked, still with his annoying smirk.

 

Get the stupid bishop! I though furiously. The darned things have taken me out twice in a row! I was hopelessly confused though, and I noticed Webber's eyes light up as they scoured the board. “Check...mate?”

 

Wilson had left earlier in the day to go find the birchnut forest I had found the birchnuts in. Frustrated as I was that he had taken the book from me, I had to admit he was putting it to good use. I thought long and hard about the conversation we had prior to his adventure as Webber began to set up the pieces again.

 

“We'd better be careful... I've been looking through this thing.” He had flipped through a few pages of the black book, his brow furrowed in worry. “There are these... monsters... they are labeled as 'giants'.” He had proceeded to tell us what the five main ones were. “The first one is the one we'd have to worry about now. It's called the Bearger... it's big.” He had warned. “Like... very big. It has enormous claws and oily black and white fur. It only comes out of hibernation during the autumn though.

 

“The second one seems even more dangerous. It's called the Deerclops. It's bigger than even the Bearger, and can freeze you! Its hands are like claws and it has thick, gray fur across the length of its whole body. Its antlers could also do damage if it bucks at you. This one comes during the Winter.

 

“The third one comes out during the spring, and it's called the Goose Goose. It is most likely the largest of them all. As you can tell by her name, she looks like a large Goose with antlers. Her moslings are dangerous as well.” I remembered this detail specifically well because I remembered thinking Are you telling me babies are stronger than the fully grown mother?

 

“The fourth one... the fourth one is a summer dweller. She's called the Dragonfly. She's not as big as some of the others, but she has claws that could impale you on accident, and fire at her clawtips. She is the most territorial and the most protective of her young.

 

“The last one is called the Ancient Guardian but...” He had flipped through the pages again, sighing as he reached one page that looked like it had been burned out minus the name 'Ancient Guardian' at the top of the scroll. “I don't know anything about it. It looks like someone destroyed it, but I don't know why they would. It seems pointless.”

 

“Uh hey, you ready to get your butt kicked at Chess again or are you gonna sit there all day looking off into space?” The spider waved his hands over the game. “We're completely fine with default winning- just so you know.”

 

 

“WHAT? NO! JUST... MAKE YOUR MOVE.”

 

“Okay, you asked for it.” He looked at the board for a few moments then looked back up at me. “Actually, why don't you go first? You haven't so far... maybe it's giving us an unfair advantage?” He grinned as though he really did not believe that, he just really wanted me to make the first move. Suspicious of his intent, I scanned my data banks for any idea of a good first move in Chess. All the intelligent of a super computer can't help me it seems! I thought, exasperated, as nothing came up. I did a simple King Pawn opening. And I really hate the smug look he has... it's like he can read my mind...

 

Literally four moves later I was caught in another checkmate. I stared, gaping, at it. “HOW-”

 

“We had a life before all of this, ya' know. We're surprised, if we are honest without ourself, how well our Chess skills remained intact after... well, you know.”

 

There was a few minutes of silence between us.

 

“...YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME HOW TO DO THAT...”

 

“What? The four-move checkmate?”

 

“...MAYBE...”

 

“So it's easier to do it if you are the starting player...” He pointed to the pawn in front of his King. “King Pawn, you know that, right?” I nodded, interested. “Okay, move it forwards twice.” I did so, and he mirrored me. “Move your white-squared bishop so it threatens this pawn on our side.” He tapped the top of the pawn in front of his black-squared bishop, then as I moved it he brought his knight out in a typical opening. “Move your queen four squares diagonally so it is attacking the same pawn from the corner.” He took his other knight out. “Take out the pawn and there you go.” He leaned back. “Checkmate.”

 

“WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT?”

 

“It's called the Scholar's Mate... our father taught us.” He paused for a second, his gaze clouding in sorrow, then sighed. “He was fantastic at this game...” He shook his head as though dismissing old memories. “You're only supposed to be able to do it as white... we learned how to change it to work as black though.” He lifted the black king and palmed it for a moment before closing his fingers tightly over the carved piece.

 

“YOU HAVE A LOT OF HISTORY... FOR A MEATSACK.”

 

He smiled lightly as though I had complemented him, though he still had the underlying grief he had seconds before. Then he straightened, wiping his face of any other emotion than his calm smugness of beating me several times. At this moment, I wasn't even sure if he was purposely looking smug or his cracked jaw was making him look that way.

 

He reminded me too much of my captor.

 

“Say pal, you look like you're in some trouble... I believe I know a way that can get you out of this predicament, but you'll have to trust me.”

 

Trust him! My thoughts scoffed. What was I thinking? How desperate could I have been to listen to a radio?

 

And he had that very look on his face.

 

“COULD YOU PL-” was I about to resort to kindness? “WIPE THAT STUPID GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.”

 

“We have no idea what you're talking about,” he sneered, but did manage to change his expression to just a plain grin. “Happy now?”

 

“I WOULD HAVE SMACKED IT OFF BUT I FIND IT UNFAIR TO ATTACK THE CRIPPLED.”

 

“Uh-huh, and why is that?” He sounded completely disinterested.

 

“IF THE BEST A ROBOT CAN DO IS ATTACK SOMEONE WHO CAN'T FIGHT BACK IF HE WANTED TO, IT'S JUST PATHETIC. IT'S A MATTER OF PRESERVING SELF-PRIDE. NOT A MATTER OF ANY KINDNESS ON MY PART.”

 

“Ooh, someone is defensive about... something we didn't ask about? You trying to convince us or yourself?”
 

Slightly disturbed by the way he just seemed to look right through me, I frowned. “YOU, MEATSACK.”

 

He tipped his head slightly as though about to say something, but he stopped before he did, whiskers twitching. “Hey Wilson, find the trees you were looking for?” The kid asked into the brush around our campsite. As the scientist made himself shown, he waved his hands over the game again. “You'd be proud to know that WX only threatened us once and it wasn't even death. You should be proud.”

 

“And how many times did you threaten him?” He asked. He had an armful of the birchnuts. They're probably edible, I mused.

 

“None!” He protested, scowling. His expression changed for a moment. “Shoot, just remembered... you still don't know how to gut an animal, do you?”

 

Wilson stopped in his tracks. “Not... particularly...”

 

“You still have one of my rabbits?”

 

“...yes...”

 

“Bring it over here.” I saw a shudder pass through Wilson's body- he obviously held no want to prepare an animal- but he did as Webber said anyway. I flinched as Webber suddenly brandished a very sharp and very was-not-there-before knife.

 

“WHERE ON EARTH DID YOU GET THAT THING?”

 

He looked vaguely confused. “What's- nevermind. To put it bluntly, we made it. As you said, WX, you get very bored sitting around doing nothing all day...”

 

I had to admit I was pretty impressed. At first glance, it looked like a real knife. But with closer examination, one could determine that- it was in fact- hand crafted. The blade was not tied, but had been wedged into the smooth wood of the handle. There were small carved dents in it and it took me a second to realize that he had specifically designed it to fit him. “It's not sharp enough to hunt with, but we made it to prepare meat.”

 

To be honest, I didn't know either, so I decided to watch. (Of course, I wasn't about to let him know he knew something I didn't)

 

Unlike his Scholar's Mate display, he said nothing in a silent demonstration. He mercilessly sliced the rabbit's head and paws off, making Wilson look a tiny-bit sick. It wasn't until he actually unzipped the animal that I started to feel sick as well. He still didn't look concerned in the slightest bit, ignoring our horrified looks and the blood that was staining the rabbit's brown pelt red. He paused for a moment during the actual cleaning though. “Are we just talking about the meat part or are we expected to show you the wonderful biology of a rabbit?” To my eyes, all of the intestines looked the same- pink and squishy and just disgusting- but he seemed to be able to tell the difference well enough. “Well, the heart and liver tend to be edible-”

 

“Don't you think about it,” Wilson warned.

 

“Neither of you have proper survival instincts!” He taunted, but discarded the insides anyway. “You both look like you swallowed a whole frog. Trust us! It'll be worth it! WX, we're not going to lie. If you weren't a robot, you'd probably be puking right now.”

 

I felt like I wanted to despite my distinct lack of the organs required to do so.

 

“You'll both see. We can't survive off of berries forever.” He grinned at me. “It'll be you two doing it next.”

 

When neither of us replied, he sighed and stuck his now bloodied dagger in the ground. “Fine. But we aren't going to be the one to feed you two. Wilson, you should know above all of us you can't survive without meat.”

 

Protein. I mentally corrected. But he's right. I echoed his sigh. “GIVE ME THE OTHER RABBIT.”“I haven't seen much fighting from you two lately,” I commented to WX. We were traveling through the grasslands where the bees were, more enjoying the weather than actually doing something productive. The robot shrugged.

 

“IT WOULD BE PATHETIC OF ME TO ATTACK A CRIPPLED CHILD,” he murmured. “DESPITE THE FACT THAT I WOULD WISH TO. IT WOULD BE STOOPING TO A... WEAK LEVEL. ALL I AM SAYING IS I AM BETTER THAN THAT.” He examined his hands closely. The night before he had accidentally slashed apart the metal on his right palm, but it seemed to have started to heal by some form of... dare I say it... magic. Perhaps there is a scientific explanation to it. The rational part of my mind rambled. Perhaps the world is stuck in a sort of permanent flux that causes things that would not normally happen in our world to be normal.

 

Whether is was this or just he was doing something behind the scenes was beyond me. Either way he seemed rather pleased as the condition of the wound. He cupped his hands together before continuing. “WHEN DO YOU THINK HE'LL BE WALKING AGAIN?”

 

I raised an eyebrow. “Walking? I'm not sure... but fighting, that'll be awhile.”

 

“I SAID NOTHING ABOUT FIGHTING.”

 

“You were thinking it.”

 

“I HIGHLY DOUBT THE LIKES OF YOU COULD UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE MECHANICAL MIND.”

 

I stifled a snort of laughter, which earned me a glare. “I'm sorry, you don't seem particularly... advanced.”

 

“IF YOU HAD ANY IDEA OF MY ORIGINS, YOU WOULDN'T EVEN DARE SUGGEST THAT I AM TECHNOLOGICALLY IMPAIRED.”

 

“I'm not suggesting you are technologically impaired,” I protested. “I'm just saying the way you speak doesn't suggest you are of any greatest intelligence than we are.”

 

“YOU ARE SAYING I AM OF YOUR LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE? AND HOW IS THAT NOT TECHNOLOGICALLY IMPAIRED EXACTLY?”

 

I sighed. “Look. Maybe we should get off of this topic and back to the one at hand.”

 

“RIGHT.”

 

“Now I have to admit, he seems to be healing remarkably fast. It might be another factor of this world, such as the ability for you to heal. It seems to be in the same vein. Honestly, I'd love to do some more research on this world.”

 

“I DON'T PLAN ON BEING HERE LONG ENOUGH TO FIND MUCH OUT ABOUT IT.”

 

“Or perhaps this isn't another world?” I went on thoughtfully. “WX, have you considered the possibility of this being a dream?”

 

“HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF SHUTTING UP ANYTIME SOON?”

 

“Oh- sorry.”

 

“ABOUT TIME,” he muttered under his breath as a moment of silence went by.

 

Still. Perhaps it is just a simulation. Did someone hook me up to some sort of dream machine to examine my behavior in a scientifically illiterate world such as this? That would explain Webber... and the super fast healing. Wait no... that can't be. I got stung by a bee earlier... and it hurt! I felt a headache coming on. Uhg... I'm just one person. I can't hope to discover this world's secrets so easily by myself, and the likelihood of one of the other two helping is just about as likely as them becoming like, best friends so... yeah, that's not gonna happen anytime soon.

 

A noise far off in the distance caught my attention. “Hey... did you hear that?”

 

He snapped his gaze to me, looking frustrated that I, yet again, tried talking to him, and he opened his mouth to snap at me when he slammed it shut as the noise pierced the air again. “WHAT IS THAT?” He whispered.

 

“Hounds,” I hissed through gritted teeth.

 

“...HOUNDS?”

 

“Yes hounds! Get your weapon out!” Slightly confused, the robot brought out his wood-chopping axe while I brandished a makeshift spear that I had been working on before I left earlier that day and stood back-to-back with him. “Come fight me you brutes!” I challenged as the howls grew louder and nearer.

 

The beasts became visible; a group of black beasts larger than any other dog breed I had ever seen with lolling pink tongues and sharp white teeth that reflected the sun. There were only four luckily, but that didn't subtract from the fact that they were big and probably wanted to eat us.

 

As the first one leaped towards my neck, I raised the spear and its own inertia buried the sharp end into it's shoulder. It howled and dropped back, snarling. Behind me, I heard the sickening crack of WX smashing the axe into one's head, and spraying us all in blood. I let out a noise of protest just as another one of the aggressors lunged forward and ripped the spear out of my hand. WX instantly saw my danger and swung his axe in a wide arc before cracking it across its neck. My assumption was that the fourth one had fled to a distinct lack of fourth hound.

 

“Is that it?” I wondered aloud. “It sounded like there was more.”

 

“THERE MOST LIKELY IS MORE.” A wild grin spread across his face.

 

“What do you-” I cut myself off, catching his meaning with a slightly panicked feel. “Webber!” I waited a few seconds after Wilson disappeared to follow. My mind was no particular rush, but I found my feet carrying me faster until I, too, was running. Calm down! I silently yelled at myself. It's just the kid! Naturally, my mind was completely ignored.

 

To be honest, I really should have expected the sight I saw when I got back to camp, although I couldn't help a pang of relief- No! That's not relief... is disappointment! I thought furiously. Apparently I missed something though, because, quite amusingly, Wilson had done something to tick him off.

 

“We had it under control!” The spider protested as I broke through the tree line.

 

“There was four hounds! WX and I had to take two each!”

 

The look on Webber's face resembled that of someone who had bitten into something foul. Wilson let out a heavy sigh as though trying not to start something, then turned to see me standing behind him. “You got here awfully quickly,” he commented. “You know, for someone who walked and doesn't care.”

 

“HONESTLY. I DIDN'T RUN HERE TO CHECK ON HIM,” I huffed. “I RAN BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD. ESPECIALLY IF HE HAD TO TAKE ON FOUR HIMSELF... BEING CRIPPLED AND ALL.”

 

“We didn't even attack them.” Webber snorted with a hint of laughter. “They just sat there staring at us until Wilson appeared. Still uneeded, by the way.”

 

“There was no telling if they were actually going to attack you!”

 

“They were cowards. Don't get me wrong, we're flattered you two care.” His voice dripped with sarcasm.

 

“HE CARES.”

 

“You care too,” he replied instantly in a sing-song voice.

 

He didn't even flinch a I took a threatening step towards him.

 

“Did you just wake up?” Wilson asked, apparently trying to abruptly change the subject.

 

“We've been awake for an hour or two. Been completely bored though because... well, there's not much to do when you can walk. Next time you guys leave us, bring like, a couple of rabbits or something so we can do something productive, because you two still get queasy about gutting an animal.”

 

“I DO NOT GET 'QUEASY'. SUCH A FEELING CANNOT EXIST FOR ME,” I lied slightly. It was true it should not exist, but I was pretty sure that the feeling I had when he showed us how to prepare a rabbit was reminiscent to the feeling of queasiness.

 

“Whatever you say, WX. You aren't the best at lying, by the way, but we'll pretend we can't notice if that makes you feel better.”

 

I scowled at him, but before I could retort Wilson stepped between us, completely ignoring the fact we were having a very nice discussion. He said nothing against either of us, and instead raised a hand and looked at me. “You heard him. Wanna go hunting?”

 

I nodded, thankful for something to do, though burning silently inside. As if I actually care what happens to him. Well...I shifted uncomfortably. I don't want him dead...

 

Yes I do! That is my whole purpose! I can't let it down!

 

I've already let it down. A surge of pure fury shot through me directed towards the kid. And it's all your fault! If it finds out that I'm growing attached to fleshlings... I shivered, personally not wanting to go through that. I'll be killed... right on the spot. All because of you... Sanity was a very tedious thing to keep when you're surrounded by creatures who live to kill you... and even more so when you are nearly unable to fight back. We had lived alone for such a long time, though, we had expected it not to hit us nearly as hard... the warning of insanity wasn't even something we had time or patience to worry about. It seemed like such a minor threat in the grand scheme of things...

 

Perhaps it was the terrifying encounter with the tree guard finally catching up to us? Perhaps it was the knowledge of how if something wanted to kill us, we could not run. With so many possible factors and such a lack of other things to think about, you'd think that the concept would have been planned or even considered.

 

It wasn't.

 

We didn't even realize what was happening at the time. After a particularly bad dream which the details of we couldn't correctly grasp, we awoke to near darkness. Wilson was asleep, though he looked rather uncomfortable, and WX- who didn't need sleep- was watching the dying flames of the fire with a sort of fondness that suggested it would be a terrible idea to disturb him. We flinched at the own sound of our ragged breathing as we struggled to calm our racing heart. The undisturbed terror of seemingly nothing should have been a clear indicator of what was soon to happen. It took us a moment to realize what exactly had sent us into such a panic.

 

It was the shadows.

 

No, these weren't ordinary shadows. These shadows had eyes. Cold, callous, viciously hungry eyes. They didn't make any move to lunge at us, though. They just sort of... watched. We could sense that these eyes held billions of thoughts. They were most certainly sentient. They all blinked, together, slowly, like they all belonged to the same monstrous beast. We shifted closer to the fire to the best of our ability without moving our damaged legs too much. WX didn't pay any attention. The sky was hesitatingly turning lighter on the horizon, and the very second the new sunlight touched the eyes they vanished, revealing nothing but the peaceful woods that surrounded the camp. We bit our lip uncertainly. The uncertainty didn't last long because the next thing to strike was a splitting headache. We quickly shut our eyes from the light, but it didn't help. It only made it worse as scenes began to play out through our head.

 

Us, alone, in the middle of winter and soaked with blood.

 

A blue blade.

 

Fire licking the woods around us.

 

A clawed hand; a wicked grin.

 

A wail of piercing grief.

 

A golden crown.

 

Fear.

 

Blood.

 

Death.

 

Darkness.

 

The unconscious part of our mind knew it was insanity.... the rest of us was too terrified to listen. Memories were flashing faster than we could process them.

 

A cry for help.

 

A scarring betrayal.

 

Emptiness.

 

It fell away almost suddenly, leaving us gasping for breath like we had just emerged from deep water. This seemed to catch the robot's attention. He glanced at us as we inched our hand toward our head. He sort of froze as though trying to figure out what the heck was happening. Our migraine began to subside, so WX shrugged and turned back to the fire without a word.

 

It was still bad enough, however, that the second we felt the hand on our shoulder we yelped and nearly slashed Wilson, who flinched back at our violent reaction.

 

“Ah! Webber! It's me!” He shouted as though we didn't realize.

 

“Oh.. sorry.”

 

“LOOKS LIKE THE WORLD'S FINALLY GETTING TO HIM,” WX commented with a hint of a sneer in his voice.

 

“Stop,” he snapped, glaring at the robot. “You're not impressing anyone.”

 

“I'M NOT TRYING TO IMPRESS ANYONE,” WX retorted. “I WAS MERELY STATING A SIMPLE FACT.”

 

Wilson ignored this and shifted a few paces closer. “Are you okay?”

 

We clenched our teeth and shook our head, the headache beginning to return. Ugh... what is this? “It hurts...”

 

“What does?”

 

“...everything.”

 

The scientist's brow furrowed with concern, but before he could say anything else something dark behind him rose up with a silent roar. “Watch out!” I yelped, throwing our arms over our head and shaking slightly. Wilson instinctively ducked and rolled to the side.

 

But the blow we expected never came. We dared to peek over our arm to see that whatever monster had been about to attack us had disappeared into thin air. We stared at the empty air for a second, our jaw hanging open. “Unfair!” I protested. “There was something there, we swear!”

 

Wilson frowned, dusting himself off. He said nothing, but after a few seconds of him examining us with concern in his gray eyes he reached forward and put his hand on our forehead. We stifled a hiss of fear at the sudden movement, but he paid little attention and drew back. "You're burning up," he sighed. "That's probably what's wrong..." His gaze flicked to our arm and back.

 

“AWW, WHAT'S WRONG? LITTLE KID SICK?”

 

...I'm probably running a fever because I'm seeing things... like that's logical.

 

“WX, if you're going to be like that, the least you can do is go hunting or something.”

 

WX stood to his full height instantly. “I'M NOT GOING TO BE GUTTING ANY ANIMALS!” He protested. “WITH THE FURRY HALF-BREED OVER HERE OUT OF THE EQUATION, WHO DO YOU THINK WILL BE DOING THE DIRTY STUFF AROUND HERE?”

 

Half-breed! If we weren't crippled, that probably would have been enough provocation to attack him again. We opened our mouth to snap at him, but shut it abruptly as Wilson gave both of us the 'glare-of-death'. "You," he pointed towards WX. "Out there." He pointed to an area where be unexplored farther out. The robot scowled at us but said nothing as he stomped away. "Hey, will you be alright on your own?" Wilson lowered his voice and crouched to become eye-to-eye with us.

 

We nodded, brushing away the beads of sweat forming on our forehead. “We'll just... sleep or... something...”

 

He patted our shoulder, smiling. “Hopefully WX and I will be able to get you back on your feet soon.”

 

“Hope and truth are two different things,” I muttered, too quiet for the scientist to hear.

 

“I'll go explore a bit towards the way we were going when the hounds attacked. I should be back before dark...”

 

“And as for WX?”

 

He shrugged. “You know him... not much I can do.”

 

“Good point... well, good luck... like I said we'll just... catch up on our sleeping.” To show him we would, we stretched and lied into a more comfortable position. He chortled lightly.

 

“See you soon.” Perhaps I should have been paying more attention. Perhaps I should have been thinking less of my predicament with the two rivals and more of the fact I knew next to nothing about this land. The book helped, but it couldn't describe just how awful the creatures really were, as evidenced by the hound attack. Of course, go figure, it never occurred to me to pay that close attention.

 

It wasn't until the beast was close enough for the entire world to shake in its presence that I realized I had just made a terrible, terrible, terrible mistake. And in the wilderness... any mistake can be fatal. At first, I was confused, thinking that there was an earthquake. If that is the case that means that this world has plates, which means it has fault lines, which means that this area should be affected more by these earthquakes and I can almost guarantee that a simulation could contain such physics.

 

Before I could even comprehend what was happening the forest around me gave a giant heave, and the tree nearest to me was cut clean through, slid and fell with an earsplitting crash. With the leaves and branches now gone from their spot, the monster was presented clearly to me.

 

Its bottom fur was almost entirely black with the occasional hint of silver mixed in. Long white fur was draped over its shoulders and down its back almost like a natural cape. The sunlight glinted off of its soulless white eyes, sharp, needle-like teeth, and a white stripe that parted the black fur on its head. And it. Was. Massive. It was slightly bigger than the trees and ripped away undergrowth like it was made of paper. It paused for just a second in its rampage when it met my gaze.

 

The Bearger... I thought in horror. It dropped onto all fours and roared at me so loudly I was temporarily deafened, then lashed out a huge paw and hitting me hard enough to send me into a tree. I wasn't hit by its claws, but it was still a painful collision. The oddest thing happened after that. The second I was out of its way, its snarl dropped and it continued its way through the forest. I lay still, panting against the tree and waiting until the artificial earthquake died away before trying to stand. I let out a gasp of pain as I put pressure on my right leg, then nearly smacked myself. For crying out loud, are we all destined to get beat down until we can't do anything anymore? I thought furiously. I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm my racing heart, then started to limp home. I knew that something like this would happen soon. It was inevitable. Fleshlings weren't created to be able to withstand as much as a machine. This is the very reason I was not at all surprised to hear of the damaging effect Wilson's encounter with one of the very beasts he warned Webber and me about. What I was surprised about, however, was how it hardly seemed to have an effect on his mental state given how tedious sanity was for them. Or perhaps it's just a problem that the half-breed has, my mind sneered. It was dusk by this point, so the fire was up. Webber's gaze was remote, fixed on the dancing flames reflected in his blank eyes. Wilson was nearer to the flickering light, his pant leg pulled up as he examined the damage that the bearger had done to his leg. The worst I saw was blood smeared which was obvious to tell due to the fact all his clothes beneath his waist were stained red. “Could be worse...” he murmured to himself.

 

“WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING?”

 

“More than a couple of scrapes,” he admitted. “I'm not complaining of course, but the force that beast hit me... it should have at least fractured something.” He glanced at Webber and sighed. “Which makes it even more shocking the amount of damage he took from the tree guard... I thought the giants would be the worst possible scenario, but if the Bearger is somehow weaker than the trees...” He looked wearily at the pines around us. “I don't know how we'll be able to do anything without worrying about something attacking us,” he muttered.

 

“THERE'S TWO OF US.” He glared at me. “FINE. THREE OF US, THOUGH, YOU CAN HARDLY COUNT HIM. YOU COULD SIMPLY PUT YOUR SUPPOSED INTELLIGENCE TO THE TEST AND SET UP SOMETHING WHERE ONE OF US CAN LOOK FOR TROUBLE WHILE THE OTHERS WORK.” I shrugged. “UNLESS YOU DON'T LIKE TAKING ADVICE FROM THE... 'LESSER BEING'.” If some part of you truly believes you are smarter than the one whose mind is comparable to that of a super computer, I added silently. He frowned.

 

“I never called you lesser,” he protested. “I said you were probably close to our intelligence. You were the one who took it as an insult.”

 

I huffed and said nothing else. Wilson sighed and shook his head, but didn't add anything, which I quite appreciated until the silence grew almost awkward as he fiddled with the fire.

 

“YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE KID?” I asked, hoping to at least break the silence. His gaze shot up to meet mine.

 

“Of course!” He exclaimed. “He seems to be the only one who knows anything about the outside world. Unless,” He added mischievously. “you are totally okay with gutting animals like he is?”

 

I looked away instantly, and I heard him let out a peal of laughter. "I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH SKINNING ANY SORT OF FLESHLING,” I huffed pointedly. For some reason my barely concealed threat only made him laugh harder. “WHAT IS SO FUNNY?”

 

“I know you are completely serious right now,” he managed between laughs, “but I know very well you would die in less than a day if you ever did kill Webber or I. And you know it too.”
 

...Stupid scientist. Instead of saying this out loud, I opted to instead ignore it, turning back to look at the dying fire, and the way the spider's weirdly blank eyes reflected it. “WHAT DO YOU THINK IS WRONG WITH HIM?” I tried, and Wilson started laughing again.

 

“For someone who doesn't care you sure do seem to care quite a bit,” he snickered. “but all jeering aside, I'm not completely sure.” He rubbed the back of his head uncertainly. “I can't tell if he's hallucinating because of the fever or if he has the fever because he's hallucinating... I can't even tell why he would have a fever or hallucinations in the first place! Unless the infection in his arm has gotten worse, which I can't really tell because every time I try to get near him he nearly claws my face off. I wish I had the proper tools to give him proper healthcare. I really do. But it looks like we'll have to work with what we've got.” He grabbed one of the hollowed-out birchnuts he had been storing water in and started washing the scrapes and contusions across his own leg, gritting his teeth as though it hurt. “It was holding back,” he realized out loud, meeting my gaze. “It wasn't actually trying to hurt me. This... this...” He motioned wildly to his injured leg. “This is nothing compared to what it could have done to me.”

 

“WHAT WAS THE WORST IT COULD HAVE DONE?”

 

He was silent for a few moments. “It probably could have severed my entire leg,” he murmured softly. “if it didn't kill me first.” The next couple of quiet moments seemed to last forever before Wilson seemed to crack under it and continued talking. “WX... just a question... which injuries did you inflict?” I turned sharply to stare at him, confused. “I really need to know. I know you and Webber fought before you two were attacked, but which wounds did you inflict and which ones did the tree guard inflict?”

“...WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?” I demanded.

 

He raised his chin slightly. “Because I'll need to keep a closer eye on the tree guard injuries. They are more likely to get infected than anything you could deal out, plus I need to go over them for wooden shrapnel.”
 

A couple more insanity-inducing moments of silence between us. “HIS RIBS WERE PROBABLY MY DOING. AS WAS HIS JAW.”

 

“Everything you did was blunt force?”

“INDEED.”

 

He groaned, burying his face in his hands as he finished cleaning his bloodied leg and muttering “I'll have to check all of his open wounds then. He will most certainly not be happy.”

 

“IF HE'LL EVEN LET YOU NEAR HIM,” I huffed. “IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, HE'S A BIT... DELUSIONAL RIGHT NOW.”

 

"Oh, I've noticed." He gave me a wry look. "Which is exactly why I said he's not going to be happy." His eyes drifted to the black book he always kept with him. "Maybe the book has something to say about this. This is definitely not normal behavior.”

 

“I'M NOT SURPRISED HE'S SHOWING ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR. AFTER ALL... HE'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A 'NORMAL' SPECIMEN.”

 

“None of us are,” he laughed lightly. “I mean... you aren't exactly the most 'normal' specimen either, WX.” I opened my mouth to protest but he continued. “You are a robot,” he reminded me.

 

“A ROBOT. IT'S NOT UNUSUAL.”

 

“On the contrary, you are quite high-tech compared to the kinds of robots I saw in my hometown.” Wilson paused as though it was uncomfortable to talk about it. “Well... actually, I don't even recall seeing robots. I knew they existed but...”

 

“I'M THE FIRST YOU'VE SEEN?” That was unusual. Where I was built, robots where all you saw. I couldn't even remember any human contact until recently...

 

“Definitely. Especially a robot that apparently functions exactly like a human? I have to admit, you are quite interesting.” He smiled. “Would if mind if one of these days, when we have nothing to do, I did a few... experiments with you?”

 

“YES. I MIND VERY MUCH. I AM NOT A TOOL FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT.”

 

“Oh you're no fun,” he pouted. “Away with you.” He looked away and waved me off. “You suck the joy out of everything.”

 

“OH FINE. I'LL JUST GO DO SOMETHING USEFUL AND HOPEFULLY NOT GET ATTACKED BY SOME RANDOM MONSTER I SHOULD'VE HEARD A MILE AWAY.”

 

“You really are just a big killjoy.”

 

“I'M NOT A KILLJOY,” I protested. “I AM, IN FACT, TRYING TO BE PRACTICAL.”
 

He rolled his eyes. “Go explore or something... try to bring food back!”
 

“MEAT?” I asked.

 

“No no no, not unless you are up to gutting it.” He pointed with his thumb back at Webber as he stood up, resting his weight on his good leg. “He's the only one okay with it at this point. And we don't even know what's wrong with him.”

 

I glanced back at the woods. “YOU LOOK IN THAT PRECIOUS BOOK OF YOURS AND I'LL GO OUT THEN?”

 

He sighed but nodded. "You know what would be useful? Bandages. If we had any sort of bandages.”

 

I shrugged. “I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND THOSE IN THE WILDERNESS.”

 

“I know but... if you can find anything we could possibly wrap wounds up with that'd be great.”

 

“I DOUBT I WILL... BUT I GUESS THERE'S NO HARM IN TRYING.”

 

“Ah, much appreciated- and you're not listening anymore.” he chortled a bit as I turned around to walk away before he could continue speaking. Moronic fleshlings- love the sound of their own voice until they annoy everyone else.

 

I was honestly beyond glad when I was finally out of speaking range. If he keeps this up I'm going to either be deaf by the end of this or wish I was deaf.

 

In a slight daze, I let my mind wander aimlessly. I wasn't as curious about how I got here- as Wilson was- and more interested in how I could get out. Truthfully, I had no clue what this place was but I didn't really care so long as I could get back to the real world... to my world. The physics here were a bit too wonky and unusual for my liking. A robot likes pristine order. There is nothing orderly about this world. I suppose that's the wilderness for you, but it doesn't mean I have to like it. As if to prove my point of the wonky physics, I felt a sudden wave of heat pass over me even though, when I looked up, the sky had turned overcast. Ahead I could almost swear I saw the forest thinning out, and I moved quicker until I began to run towards the light, before emerging to an almost blinding brightness.

 

The ground had quickly gone from slightly dewy and soft underfoot to cracked and dry. Sand covered the ground as far as the eye could see, which was far considering the lack of trees. In their place were cacti placed randomly all over the flat area, and as I watched a herd of some strange, blue creatures with lightning-bolt shaped horns bounded into view, looking as though they were chewing on something despite there being no grass to chew on. What are they eating? Sand?

 

To the other side, a small rabbit was creeping out from the edge of the forest, eyeing the blue creatures suspiciously and I wondered for a small moment if they were deadly before an absolutely massive bird swooped from the sky and lunged towards it with outstretched talons, causing the animal to flee for cover with a high-pitched scream. The bird let out a despairing caw! before taking off again with two powerful strokes of its feathery wings. A desert, my mind unhelpfully supplied as I took in the new surroundings. I let my gaze rest on the blue creatures. I can probably ask Wilson about those things when I get back... knowing his obsession with that stupid book he'd know what they are... and if they're edible.

 

Another part I hated about this world, admittedly, was my newfound need to eat. I had never needed to before and now it was almost unbearable.

 

I officially hated yet another thing that made me more similar to these pests.

 

You know you'd be terrified without them, a small, annoying voice whispered... one I recognized well.

 

Oh, shut up. I'm not dependent on any life-form.

 

As though the universe wanted to make matters worse while simultaneously throwing me out of my thoughts, an enormous thunderclap echoed overhead, and I glanced curiously up to look at the sky. I had never been out in rain before, so I could only begin to imagine what it felt like.

 

A sharp, stinging sensation shot up and down my spine as something hit me right in the base of my neck.

 

ZAP!

 

It was weird how just a single drop of water caused an entire shower of sparks to fly out of me.

 

Yep, I was not built to be out in the rain.

 

ZAP!

 

Nearly scrabbling to get away, back into the shelter of the trees and away from the offending liquid.

 

ZAP!

 

Well, at least this was another barrier between me and fleshlings.

 

ZAP!

 

I didn't mean I had to like it.

 

By the time I had run all the way back, I was positively soaked and glowing like a Christmas tree from the sparks. Wilson had to cover his eyes and mouth to keep from laughing, and I was gladder than ever that Webber was still too out of it to say anything. I narrowed my 'eyes' at the scientist as soon as he peeked over his hand, and he shook his head, lifting his other hand to show me his dripping palms. "I'm not saying a word. Not saying a word." It was much more difficult than it should have been, but I managed to keep a straight face about WX's predicament. I wanted to laugh. I wanted to laugh so hard he would probably backhand me, but it didn't help that he sat helplessly with his backpack over his head to help shield from the rain and he was glaring at me with the most rage he could muster in a single look.

 

Honestly, I felt that I was showing great self-restraint given the circumstances.

 

However, I was having some problems searching through the book without ruining its precious information-loaded pages with the merciless rain. The short time I was given to search through it before the rains started gave me just enough time to discover that Webber's problem was, indeed, his sanity. There is no cure for insanity, I had thought with a sigh. Back in my world, people would throw the insane into an asylum and forget they existed... using them as lab rats. The book had other ideas, though. This is impossible! Picking flowers? Being near a random monster in the birchnut forest? Eating mushrooms??? What is wrong with this world??? It breaks just about every law of science that exists!

 

Well, the rain proved me wrong on that front. Gravity still existed, so that was nice. Whether or not objects fell at the same rate or not was a different matter, but the fact that it was still there, sure and strong, comforted me a bit.

 

And maybe I'll get to learn more about this world. I could create and prove scientific theories never seen before!

 

“PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS? OR WOULD YOU PREFER A MORE AMUSING WAY TO GET THEM?” WX asked with a sneer.

 

“Just thinking about something you wouldn't care about,” I replied absently. He frowned, and I realized the rain had finally stopped, although he was still sparking a bit from the rain still gleaming on him.

 

“MOST LIKELY, BUT I STILL WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT. YOU ARE MAKING SOME WEIRD FACES.”

 

“Science. I'm thinking about science. WX, do you have any idea the fame we could get if we could get out of this world? A completely undiscovered realm, where magic exists!”

 

He was silent for a couple of seconds. “ARE YOU PLANNING ON USING THE KID AS PROOF OF THIS?”

 

It took me a moment to realize 'the kid' was referring to Webber. “I wasn't planning on it, but now that you say it...”

 

“THAT'S ONE THING I WON'T DENY ABOUT HIM- HE'S INDEPENDENT AND DOESN'T LIKE OTHER PEOPLE USING HIM- LIKE MYSELF. I DON'T THINK HE WOULD APPRECIATE BEING USED AS A KICK IN THE FACE TO YOUR PRECIOUS SCIENCE.”

 

“Oh? Since when did you learn so much about him, hmm?”

 

“YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT SOMEONE BY FIGHTING AGAINST THEM THAN FIGHTING WITH THEM,” he huffed.

 

“Is that your excuse?”

 

“BESIDES,” he went on, ignoring me. “THIS IS ALL ASSUMING WE CAN EVEN SURVIVE THIS PLACE.”

 

“Are you suggesting we could die here?”

“NOTHING HERE HAS BEEN FRIENDLY, IF YOU'VE REALIZED. THE ONLY ONES HERE WHO ARE WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER.” WX crossed his arms. “AND I AM ALMOST CERTAIN THAT BOOK OF YOURS WILL BACK ME UP.”

 

He's right, I realized, mentally going over what I had read in the book. Almost nothing in there is friendly.

 

“SPEAKING OF YOUR BOOK, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD LOOK UP A CREATURE FOR ME?”

I stared at him for a moment, dumbfounded. “You want me to actually look at something for you?”

 

“UNLESS YOU'D BE WILLING TO COUGH IT UP, WHICH I NATURALLY ASSUMED YOU'D BE TOO STUBBORN TO DO.”

 

I sighed, knowing I wasn't going to be going anywhere with him. “Okay, just... describe it to me.”

 

“IT'S BLUE,” he started, looking slightly unhappy for some reason. “WITH JAGGED HORNS. BLANK EYES? ALMOST GOAT-LIKE?”

 

I flipped open the black leather book and flipped through its pages, trying to recall the creature he was talking about. “Where did you see this?”
 

“I FOUND A DRY BIOME- DESERT I PRESUMED.”

 

“After this, we need to do something about Webber,” I reminded him as I searched.

 

“I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU EXPECT ME TO DO.”

 

“Us to do,” I corrected. “And I'm not sure. There's something in here about mushrooms...?”

 

Much to my surprise, he let out a weird burst of garbled static, which I realized must have been laughter. “HOW DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO HELP? EVEN IF THERE WAS SOME MAGIC MUSHROOM THAT COULD HELP WHATEVER THE HECK IS WRONG WITH HIM, THERE IS NO WAY WE COULD MANAGE TO GET THE KID TO EAT THEM.”

 

It was my turn to laugh, imagining the guaranteed anger he would show if we tried to force-feed him. "We'll find a way," I said.

 

“WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?” He asked, sounding very much like he wanted to laugh again.

 

“Oh! Is this what you were talking about?” Before answering his question, I stopped on the volt goat page and turned it to him.

 

“VOLT GOAT? WHAT AN ODD SPECIES NAME. IS IT EDIBLE?”

 

"Yep. But we'll have to get Webber back first." I shivered slightly, remembering his silent, almost savage demonstration in gutting the rabbit. He had shown no sadness nor remorse. In fact, he had shown no emotion at all, minus a quiet determination set in his features.

 

It was borderline terrifying.

 

I was afraid that if I was forced to do that myself, I'd begin to lose my own remorse for the smaller animals. That and I felt beyond sick at seeing it happen and I could imagine how terrible it'd be if I had to partake.

 

I shook my head wildly. I need to stay focused. “How do you want to go about this?”

 

“ABOUT WHAT?”

 

“The mushrooms.”

 

“OH. WELL, WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE?”

 

“They look like- well, a green mushroom. It has to be cooked though, or it might make matters worse. Got it? Got it? I'm talking poison here, WX, don't get any funny ideas.”

 

He tipped his chin, looking slightly offended. “IF I WAS TO KILL HIM, IT WOULD NOT BE BY SUCH AN UNDERHANDED TACTIC AS POISON.”

 

“I'm glad that you are so generous,” I said sarcastically.

 

The slightest twitch of his face, the smallest lift of his frown, and I think for the first time since I met him I saw him smile, even just a little bit. I knew it! I knew there was a nicer robot in there somewhere, WX!

 

He shook his head, the smile still on his face. “COME ON. WE'RE BURNING DAYLIGHT. LET'S JUST GET THIS OVER WITH.”

 

Webber's POV
 

Our head felt like someone had stuffed it full of cotton and used it as a kickball. Everything was clouded and it hurt like heck.

 

We could think though.

 

And we could move.

 

So that was honestly an improvement.

 

It was dark, as it appeared the sun had set hours before. Wilson was fast asleep, muttering something in his dreams and WX had his back towards us, facing the flames. We pushed ourself up with one hand, using the other to hold our aching head. At first, we had thought that he didn't realize we were awake, but when he spoke it was without looking at us.

 

“FEELING BETTER?” He asked, a sort of gentleness in his tone that was completely unexpected, especially from him. “YOU WERE OUT OF IT FOR QUITE AWHILE. IT TOOK US A DAY OR TWO TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH YOU.” He finally turned to look at us, the fire's light creating dancing patterns of flames against his face and making him appear almost ghastly as though he was not of this world. “DID YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW SANITY AFFECTS PEOPLE HERE?”

 

“Y-yes,” I stammered, feeling our voice crack as though it hadn't been used in awhile. “Of course. We just... didn't realize...”

 

He looked back towards the fire. “WILSON SAID YOU'D BE ABLE TO WALK AGAIN SOON,” he informed us quietly.

 

“That'd be nice.”

 

“HE'S SURPRISED ON HOW WELL YOU'VE BEEN HEALING. HE WAS ATTACKED WHILE YOU WERE OUT AND HE'S STILL FEELING THE EFFECTS OF IT, EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T NEARLY AS BAD AS YOU INJURIES. IS THERE A REASON YOU ARE ABLE TO HEAL FASTER THAN ANY FLESHLING I'VE KNOWN ABOUT?”

 

“Where we're from, it isn't unnatural.” We tipped out head, our clearing mind now a whirlwind of confusion at seeing this side of him. It's kind of creepy actually. “Why...? With the injuries we had... how long would it take for people to heal where you're from?”

 

He was silent for a moment. “YOU'RE NOT FROM EARTH, ARE YOU?”

 

The question took us way off guard. “W-we're not sure where we're from, to be honest.”

 

“YOU SPOKE OF IT AS THOUGH YOU DO, IN FACT, KNOW.”

 

“It's not that,” I protested. “I-it feels natural. Like it's normal for us.”

 

“I KNOW THAT ISN'T THE TRUTH,” he said, almost so quietly we could hear it. “I KNOW THAT ISN'T THE TRUTH...” "Whoa, whoa, hey, take it easy," Wilson cautioned, supporting us with his shoulder. "You haven't been on your feet in awhile. You're probably very weak right now.”

 

“Haha, yeah, we can tell,” I laughed nervously, trying to keep from collapsing. Our knees felt weak and refused to lock into a standing position. Our legs ached, but it was a slight pain, not at all like the burning agony we used to feel in them.

 

“How do you feel?” He asked.

 

“Better. A lot better actually.” We gave him a toothy grin. “Thanks a lot, Wilson. We probably would've died without you.”

 

“Nah, I don't think so. You said that you survived on your own for awhile, so we probably would die without you.” He looked thoughtful for a moment before adding, “WX seemed pretty eager to get you back on your feet. I'm not sure if he wanted to fight something or if he really wanted you better, but hey, it's a nice thought anyway.”
 

“Speaking of the devil, where is he?”

 

He laughed a bit. “I honestly have no idea. He was gone when I woke up so.” He shrugged. “He found a new area, so he might be over there, but he never tells me anything. Why'd you ask?”

 

“He was acting really strange the other day.”
 

“What do you mean?”
 

“Well... he asked if we were feeling better, you know, after the whole insanity episode?” He nodded, so we continued. “It wasn't as much what he said it was how he said it. He sounded a touch worried for some reason, and he spoke almost... gently.”
 

“Are you sure you weren't still feeling the effects of insanity?”

 

“We might've been, given the circumstances.” Beginning to get uncomfortable with the conversation, we changed the subject. “Winter's coming.”

 

“How can you tell?”

 

We didn't say anything, slightly surprised. How can you not tell? "The air is crisp," I said slowly. "and clean, like snow, is on its way. The air has a slight, frosty chill for it, that you wouldn't get unless you were very late into fall or early winter. Can't you tell?" We broke away from him holding us up and sat.

 

"Your senses must be stronger than mine because I can't tell any of that." He smiled. "Pretty impressive, Webber."

 

“Thanks,” I huffed. We didn't even walk and we're out of breath! It's going to take forever to be able to walk properly again!

 

“I don't want you two fighting,” Wilson said after a minute, and we turned sharply to look at him.

 

“We have no idea what you're talking about.”

 

“You and WX. I don't want you two fighting... or at least wait until you can walk properly again.”

 

“Whaaaat? Us, fighting? That sounds nothing like us. We are an innocent little seven-year-old, Wilson. Never hurt another person in our life.” We couldn't keep a straight face, and even Wilson cracked a smile.

 

“I can only wish.”

 

“We're angels, WX and us.”

 

“Let's see how you two are when you can walk properly. Come on, you aren't going to get your strength back sitting.” He grabbed us by the uninjured arm and pulled us up again, letting us lean against him. “Try walking.”

 

“We can't,” I puffed.

 

“Just try. One step at a time.”

 

Our legs could barely support us, but at his urging, we forced them to move. It was a jerky movement, but it was enough. It was exhausting, but despite our reluctance, we knew we had to, or else it would only get worse. Determination set in our features as we tried another step.

 

“It's going to get easier,” he promised.

 

“When?” I growled, taking another shaky and hesitant step.

 

“Eventually. You've been crippled for weeks.”

 

“Weeks?” I echoed. “It's already been weeks?”

 

He shrugged helplessly. “Come on, focus. I know this is draining your energy, but you have to.”

 

We almost argued. We almost told him to stop, but when we looked at him to see his partially relieved, partially concerned, and partially gentle and understanding, we couldn't bring ourself to. He's really trying to help us... and he's probably helping us a great deal. It's difficult now but it'll get better. “Thank you,” I managed, forcing a smile. His eyes glimmered.

 

“Trust me. You'll be better in no time.”

 

…

 

The air smelt of frost and dying leaves. With dawn came mist, giving the woods an eerie orange sheen as the light from the sun reflected off of it. We could hear animals scuffling in the undergrowth, preparing themselves for the barren winter. Food will get scarcer, but our skills will become all the more valuable. We clenched our fist around our handmade knife, feeling our fingers slide easily into the grip. This world was made for us. Just like this knife. We fit in. Squeezing our eyes shut, we tightened our grip.

 

No.

 

Reluctantly, we forced ourself to open our eyes and look around, noting the fact our hearing dimmed slightly as we did. Interesting. However tempting the blade was, we weren't that desperate.

 

Yet.

 

Stop that. You have a job to do, Webber. You have this blade for a reason. The others count on us. They act like they know what they're doing, but neither of them has proper instincts. We let out a deep breath we didn't know we were holding. This winter will be tough. We might have to carry this entire group through spring. Or at least until they understand that this world isn't going to hold their hands. This world is set out to kill us.

 

This world is going to kill us.

 

For crying out loud- Stop that Webber! We felt something warm run down our hand and through our fur, and we sharply looked down to see claws digging into our palm. We stood, closing our eyes again and letting the forest's sounds engulf our senses. When our eyes were open, we couldn't tell if the rustling was from the browning leaves still hanging on to the otherwise barren treetops or animals scurrying in the dry leaf mold, but when our eyes were closed we could hear the differences. Animals made a light thumping sound along with their rustling, while we could distinguish the faint sound of branches bumping against each other as they swayed along with their dying burdens.

 

The world was somehow almost scarier when we heard it like that.

 

There! A small, furry animal, near us. We took a few steps forward, listening, then lunged towards the sound. The brown animal, its fur beginning to turn white for the cold months ahead, screamed and thrust itself forward with surprising speed.

 

It wasn't fast enough.

 

Weeks after Wilson had given us the all-clear, we had spent trying to be able to walk and run again. Now, we were almost able to run as fast as we could before the accident, and clearly, it was enough to give us the edge on the rabbit, and not five seconds after its initial flight it was caught and stabbed by the knife in our hand. A satisfied grin set itself on our face, as we flicked the animal's blood off of our hands. We need to learn how to kill cleaner, but otherwise not a terrible kill. The mist was beginning to clear, so the sounds were becoming even louder as they were no longer deterred by the watery air.

 

We looked back at where we had come from, towards our camp. It may become difficult, but we can survive.

 

After all, it's not the first time we've been in this situation.

 

And at least this time we're not alone. I wasn't going to deny. I had honestly thought that after the whole episode with Webber being crippled, he and WX wouldn't be so aggressive towards each other. Especially given that the latter had seemed almost protective over him- despite the sharp way he showed it. Webber's confusion over WX's gentleness after he had been insane for some time only cemented this thought.

 

I was totally wrong though.

 

In fact, their arguments only got more ridiculous. For the moment, they weren't fighting, but WX had gone off again so he wasn't really there to argue with. Webber, on the other hand, was humming while working on preparing a volt goat, which it took WX and I's combined strengths to kill. The creature was a bit bigger than me, but Webber didn't even seem to notice the way it easily dwarfed him in size. His knife gleamed with blood but he paid no attention to it. It was kind of creepy if I had to be honest. I hesitated, then picked up my spear, which had been on the ground by my feet. Webber looked up at me, then went back to the goat. “Where are you going?” He asked. I squinted at him. “What?”

 

“Are you alright?” I asked. He didn't sound questioning. He sounded almost... sad.

 

“Yeah? Why do you ask?”

 

“Well, you sounded kind of sad or lost when you said that.”

 

“It's nothing. We're just concentrating. Anyway, where are you going?”

 

Frowning slightly at the obvious distraction, I debated for a moment whether or not to continue to press the subject, but I really wasn't up to getting on his bad side so I went along with it. “I was going to check out that desert WX found. We've only seen the edge of it so who knows what new animals are in the rest of it.”

 

“Okay.”

 

I paused for a moment. There was something wrong. What could be going on in your mind now...? Or, I could just be seeing problems that aren't there. I'll talk to him about it again later when he's not busy.

 

“I'll be back soon.”

 

“Good luck.”

 

…

 

“I'm leaving I'm leaving for crying out loud stop chasing me you stupid mutts!”

 

The large, blue brute behind me only barked and snapped at me, missing but so close to hitting me I could feel the chill rising from its very fur as though the hound itself was carved out of ice. And knowing this world's physics that probably isn't far from the truth. “I wasn't going near your den! I had no plans on even going near any of you!” My patience wearing thin, I flipped around and cracked my spear against the animal's head, causing it to yelp and get flung back a few paces into its pack of friends. The others scrabbled to move around their injured comrade and leaped at me, their fangs bare but falling just short of actually biting my arm off. The ones who lunged forward slowly back away until they were beside the rest of the pack. The ringleader was back on its paws, taking slow steps towards me, watching the spear I held with a cautious eye.

 

I quickly shoved the spear in the back of my shirt to free my hands while still keeping it with me and lifted my hands, stretching my fingers apart and trying to appear harmless. "See? I just want to get out of here okay? I swear I won't touch your creepy bone hills. Oh- uh, oh dear, you probably want me for your creepy bone hills, don't you? Look, I'm not good for eating. I don't have a lot of meat on my bones, see?" I rolled up my shirt's sleeve to show my thinness. "Oh darn, it's such a shame killing me won't help very much, I guess you'll have to wait for another survivor?" Am I seriously trying to reason with a pack of bloodthirsty hounds?

 

Wow, okay, stooping down to a new level of crazy Wilson. Great job. Slowly backing away from the beasts, my spear fell to the ground, but I was too afraid to stop to pick it up. Once I had gotten a good five feet away from the spear, the leader bent its head to sniff at it, not taking its pupil-less gaze off of me for a second. It raised its bluish tinted nose and sniffed the air, fixed me with one last brutal glare, and let out a dismissive bark. Without another sound, the pack turned in unison and slunk back towards their dens. My chest was tight with panic and it was hard to catch my breath, but after a minute or so I was able to move again and picked up my spear, watching out for any more of the oddly colored hounds. We had fought with the hounds before, of course, but these ones with the cold blue fur seemed entirely different. They were much bigger than their black variants, and their fangs were shaped like ragged icicles instead of being smooth and pointed. Okay, note to self. Don't go near the bone hills in the desert. I thought, my heart pounding in my ears. I stared in the direction of the monsters before choosing to go another way. I wasn't going back yet, but I was definitely not going anywhere near those hounds.

 

Eventually, the sand began to disperse, revealing hard gray stone with yellowish speckles underneath it. Along with the sand, the heat began to vanish as well, leaving a chilling frosty feel to the air and bringing with it a bitter wind. Teeth already beginning to chatter, I wrapped my arms around myself, attempting to keep some of the heat from leaving my body. I need to get back, I thought, looking towards a mound of green. A hill. I believe I've seen that one before, actually.

 

I decided it was my best bet and made my way towards it. I was just a few yards to the hill before the world seemed to flip over and my legs shot out from under me, sending me to the rocky ground and pain shot of the base of my spine. I lay on the ground for a time, trying to gather the energy to move. After several minutes had passed, I dragged myself to a sitting position, feeling the ice I had slipped on clearly now as it had mostly melted due to my body heat and soaked into my shirt and pants. My spear was a few paces away, and I realized that if I had fallen in any more awkward position I could've fallen on its point and stabbed myself on pure accident. I crawled over to the weapon again and used it to stand up, realizing the icy water had numbed any pain I had previously felt. I took a deep breath then continued my way, albeit at a much slower pace.

 

By the time I finally got back home, WX was already back from who-knows-where, a small chunk of meat in his hand. At first, I thought everything was calm. Then, I noticed he and Webber were having a glare-off, watching each other in total silence, unnaturally still, with similar angry expressions. “Oh dear, what did I miss this time?” I asked, hoping to break the awkward silence. As if it was a cue, they both looked at me, and the tension disappeared.

 

“Oh, hey,” Webber said, looking towards the empty fire pit.

 

“Why were you glaring at each other?” I pressed, exasperated.

 

“GIVE ME A REASON AND THAT'LL BE PART OF IT,” WX huffed, and I rolled my eyes.

 

“Did you find anything?”

 

“Nope. It got way too cold before I could.” I purposely, yet uneasily, left out the part about me getting chased by the blue brutes that were the hounds.

 

"Cold's right!" He exclaimed, his breath billowing out in a cloud. I laughed a little bit and started to set up the fire.

 

…

 

The next day it snowed.

 

WX seemed to be having a confusing time, trying to discover why rain seemed to affect him but snow, which was essentially its cold, powdery cousin, did not. Webber, on the other hand, appeared to be completely unable to decipher exactly what he was feeling. He flinched every time a snowflake landed on him, yet he still acted giddier than usual. Amusingly enough, I even caught him sticking his tongue out a couple times to catch the flakes in his mouth.

 

It was almost adorable to watch, actually. I wasn't going to say as much, in fear he would get mad or embarrassed, but I enjoyed seeing an almost cute side to the typically prickly spider boy. WX didn't look anywhere near as amused as I felt. In fact, he actually looked quite annoyed, as though he hated this new side of his rival for some odd reason. I frowned but didn't say anything.

 

“THIS IS ONLY GOING TO MAKE OUR SURVIVAL HARDER,” WX commented, coming to stand beside me. “I HOPE YOU HAD PLANS FOR THIS.”

 

“Haha, nope. I don't.”

 

He deadpanned. “YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?”

 

“Well, I don't have a plan.” My gaze shifted to Webber and I pointed at him. “He, however, might.”

 

“YOU'RE SERIOUSLY GOING TO RELY ON THE HALF-BRED SEVEN-YEAR-OLD FOR OUR SURVIVAL.” He rubbed the sides of his head, around where his temples would be if he were human. “YOU DO KNOW THIS IS LIFE OR DEATH, RIGHT?”

 

“Of course, but unless you have some magical ability to survive like he can I think he's our best bet.”

 

We watched Webber in silence for a second as he pounced on a snowflake, smiling childishly as it landed on his forehead instead. “HE'S A PRETTY POOR BEST. WE'RE GOING TO DIE IF WE'RE RELYING ON THAT THING.”

 

“Don't jinx us,” I said, trying to make him smile again. It was always the oddest and most interesting thing when the arrogant robot smiled. But he was already looking away, holding out his hand and letting a couple white specks gather on it without melting before he closed it into a fist.

 

“I WASN'T JINXING US. I WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.” he replied in almost a whisper, sounding defeated, before stalking away to check on the fire.

 

I blinked, almost scared for a moment. What was he trying to say? I gulped and felt my breath get shaky, and suddenly I wasn't so sure I wanted to know. “YOU'RE A MORON. YOU TOOK US ONE STEP TOO CLOSE TO DEATH, HALF-BREED,” WX hissed to a defiant Webber.

 

“We're the moron!?” Webber shouted, sounding completely enraged. “We could've saved your life you ingrate! Besides! We tried to go away from the death-monster that wanted to eat us.”
 

A lone spark flew away from the robot's shoulder, but he didn't pay much attention to it. “YOU KNOW VERY WELL WATER COULD KILL ME FAR MORE PAINFULLY THAN ANY BEAST.”

 

“It's all about you, isn't it?”

 

WX sharply pointed at me. “HE NEARLY DROWNED.”

 

“You're so afraid of water,” Webber taunted. “when really if anything's gonna kill you painfully, it's us.” WX took a threatening step forward, his fist preparing for the punch.

 

“Stop it!” I barked, thrusting my way between them and holding them at arm's length away from me. “You two have been arguing since we got back and I'm sick of it!”

 

Two enraged pairs of eyes turned to glare at me- one pair white and the other pair non-existent. “Good point Wilson! You were the one that decided to go that way even though there was something clearly there that wanted to kill all of us!" Despite the fact neither Webber nor WX was my size- WX's height brought him to about my nose and Webber's barely above my waist- they were beyond intimidating when they were both glaring at me with such intensity either might attack at any second.

 

“It was none of our faults! It was a simple mistake anyone could have made! Perhaps a mistake that needed to be made to learn about this world!”
 

“YOU FORGET THIS IS THE SAME ONE THAT WAS STUPID ENOUGH TO RUN RIGHT INTO THE BEARGER,” WX sneered.

 

“And you two got attacked by a tree guard not three days after we came here,” I growled, my patience wearing thin. I took a deep breath, trying not to lash out. “It's winter. We can't keep arguing and fighting like this if we want to survive it.”

 

“WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS IF THE GENIUS ACTUALLY PLANNED SOMETHING.”

 

“Look here.” Finally snapping, I abandoned my stance to keep the two apart to shove my face into WX's. “We need each other to survive. We've made it this far together, and we can get through this together.”

 

“WE DON'T NEED YOU, SCIENTIST.” Before I could even respond or comprehend what was going on, I was flung backward, holding my nose as the world tilted and pain blossomed through my face. Something warm and sticky was dripping through my fingers, and it took me a second to realize exactly what happened and jumped forward instantly to return the punch. Before I could, however, I fell, still dizzy after the sudden trauma to my face. In the corner of my eye, I saw Webber lunge towards him, his knife gripped tightly in his hand as he apparently aimed to stab the robot in the chest with it. WX spotted the attack, though, and quickly grabbed Webber's dominant hand, apparently squeezing it a bit judging by the expression on the boy's face.

 

WX ignored him and instead glared down at me. “YOU ARE NOTHING BUT TROUBLE,” he spat, and it took me a second to realize he was still talking to me. “YOU AREN'T STRONG, YOU AREN'T FAST, YOU AREN'T EVEN SMART EVEN THOUGH THAT'S WHAT YOU APPARENTLY PRIDE YOURSELF ON. WE DON'T NEED YOU.”

 

“You're wrong! I'm the only one who knows anything about medicine and wounds!”
 

“We wouldn't need that if we never got hurt,” Webber answered, breaking away from WX's vice grip and rubbing his wrist with muffled growls.

 

“Oh? And you think you can fight beasts like that on your own?”
 

“WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT THEM IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY TO FIGHT THEM!”

 

I narrowed my eyes, switching the hand holding my nose and pulled myself to my feet. “You know what? Maybe you're right.” I grabbed my spear and grabbed it tightly until my knuckles popped. “And maybe I don't need you either.” With that final comment, I turned and marched away, and I could feel their gazes boring into my back. No more. They can go get themselves killed if they want, but I'm not going to be a part of it.

 

…

Earlier

...

“It's too cold,” Webber complained, his breath billowing out in a cloud. “We're gonna freeze to death.” He looked up at the frosty branches above us. Even though this place had been a beautiful place during the fall with its multi-colored leaves, seeing the birch forest in winter was an even more amazing sight. The firey leaves that had clung to their perches in the months before now carpeted the ground and shone with a certain sparkle only frost and snow could give.

 

“Nonsense!” I replied cheerfully. “You're just being dramatic.”

 

"I'M NOT PARTICULARLY ADVANCED IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF YOU MEATSACKS," WX mused. "BUT I'M PRETTY SURE COLD CAN KILL YOU QUITE EASILY."

 

“It's not that cold. Besides, we haven't all been exploring together since... well, I don't think we ever have, and I'd like to do that before it actually gets cold and we have to deal with that.” I crossed my arms as Webber rolled his eyes- which was quite impressive given he had no pupils.

 

“Fine. Have us catch our death of pneumonia, see if we care when you idiots get yourselves killed without us.” He shoved me in an almost affectionate manner. He was in a surprisingly good mood considering his recent bout of mild depression. I laughed a bit and continued walking, but Webber stopped suddenly, his whiskers twitching. “We shouldn't go there,” he said uneasily. WX and I just looked at him.

 

“Why not?”

 

“We've learned to use our gut feeling to figure out where to go.” He shook his head and pointed towards the path I was following. “That's not safe.”

 

“YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS,” WX scoffed. “THE ONLY THING THAT'S NOT SAFE IS STANDING AROUND IN THE COLD WAITING TO FREEZE TO THE GROUND.”

 

“It's not safe!” He insisted. “We know! We've survived out in the wild before. You have like- what- a couple of months of experience?”

 

"It doesn't matter. We're going to keep going." I scowled at the kid. He had to learn sooner or later that he wasn't the boss around here. Given his age, he shouldn't even be out there. For all we knew, he could've been lying about everything.

 

“You're going to regret that,” he hissed, but he followed anyway.

 

The path was actually better lit than the one we had been on previously. Bramble and brush had been shoved away as though it was a path often used by others. Maybe other humans! I thought hopefully, the idea bringing speed to my feet.

 

In hindsight, I couldn't have been more wrong.

 

Eventually, we reached a vantage point of the forest. You could look at it and see the entire wood, including a distant smudge I assumed was the savanna that separated the birch forest and the forest of evergreens that our base was hidden in. That wasn't what caught my attention though. Beside me, Webber stiffened with fear and even tough WX froze. For the longest moment, we weren't able to speak, and the silence felt unnatural before Webber finally broke it.

 

“That's a big deer,” he hissed.

 

As though the sound of his voice wasn't as quiet as it had been, the monstrous beast was obviously alerted to our presence. It was far below us and probably a mile away, and considering how steep the landscape fell away from where we stood, it shouldn't have been able to get us. The moment that single, vicious eye locked on me, a deep feeling of dread made its way into my chest.

 

It was a certain feeling I was about to die.

 

I knew I was about to die.

 

I tried to take a step back but my legs refused to listen. The Deerclops and I stared at each other for what felt like an eternity. It roared and took a step forward. The ground shook under its enormous weight. "Guys," I forced out, even though my throat felt like it was full of gravel. As though breaking them from a trance, they slowly turned to look at me. "Run."

 

The calmly give order conflicted with its urgency, but they picked it up. Behind us, I could hear the beast's heavily thumping feet as it gave chase. I was going to die.

 

I was going to die.

 

I risked a glance behind me only to have pure terror drive me to run faster as the Deerclops cleared the drop in a single bound, its eye red with anger. WX was just behind me, and Webber was ahead of me. I gritted my teeth and pushed my body to its limit. I was already running out of breath, and even if I could think of a way out of this I couldn't breathe well enough to tell the others.

 

I was trapped in this state until I ran out of breath and then? What would become of me? Well, I'd probably get eaten by that one-eyed monster, so that wasn't really an option. My sense of direction had long since fled me, and I just blindly followed Webber's lead. When he stopped I barely stopped in time to keep from crashing into him. "What are you doing? Move!” I shouted, but he shook his head stiffly. I looked beyond him to see greenish blue motion, sloshing endlessly around until it met the sky and most likely even further.

 

The ocean.

 

It was the end of the line. Just as WX skidded to a half beside me, Webber flipped around with a scowl. The Deerclops, as though it had realized its prey was cornered, seemed to grin as it slowed down, apparently content to literally scare us to death.

 

“Jump.” WX and I sharply glared at him.

 

“IMPOSSIBLE.”

 

“Is that all you've got?” Webber challenged the Deerclops, stepping a bit closer to it. Now that it was up close, I could see just how large it truly was. It was taller than three of the trees around us put together and then some. It terrified me. How Webber was able to walk towards it like that was far beyond me. “Chasing pathetic, starving, and weak humans to their death?” He bared his teeth. “That's just sad, even for such an oversized throw rug.” He spat the last two words.

 

“We have to jump.” Desperation began to sink in as WX shook his head. “He's going to get himself killed if we don't.”
 

“YOU'RE GOING TO GET ME KILLED IF WE DO!” He protested.

 

I frowned, trying to think quickly. The Deerclops took a step closer to us, nearly shaking me off of the cliff face. “Hold your breath.” I didn't even have times to register Webber's words before I had been shoved over the edge.

 

I was in free-fall, the waves rapidly coming closer. I took the deepest breath I could muster before I hit the water. I felt my legs being caught by the undertow, but the adrenaline rush and the frantic flight drained me of almost all of my energy. I just managed to look up, seeing that single eye one final time before it turned and stalked away, apparently satisfied with how dead we were.

 

…

 

I coughed up a lungful of water, the salt stinging my throat and making my eyes water. I rolled onto my side with a soft groan, coughing up somehow still more water. How much did I swallow? I wondered dazedly.

 

"You're alright," Webber breathed- the first sign that I wasn't alone. I squinted up at him, trying to blink away the blurriness to make our any details of his face. I tried to speak, but my throat was burning too much. "WX is okay too. He's back at camp. We waited for you for a bit but when you didn't appear we came back for you."

 

“How long was I out?” I croaked.

 

“A couple hours at most.”

 

I frowned and struggled into a sitting position.

 

“Are you okay?”

 

“I'm fine.” That wasn't completely true. My limbs felt like they were made out of lead and my head felt like it was full of cotton.

 

“We'd better get back soon, then.”

 

…

 

I tossed my head to the side. It didn't matter. I didn't need them. My spear weighed heavily on my shoulder, but the I admittedly like the sensation that there was something other than me. Half of the forest was in between the other two and me before I was able to relax. I took a deep breath and pressed my back against a tree and slid to the ground. I clenched my fists. If they didn't want me, I didn't want them. It wasn't survival anymore, it was a contest.

 

A contest I didn't plan on losing. Admittedly, my entire outburst had only a single reason.

 

I was absolutely terrified. I could only think of one other occasion in my entire life I had ever been so scared, and I wasn't particularly fond of that subject. Slowly, as though any faster movement could alert that beast again, Webber bent down and picked up his knife, which had fallen when I grabbed his hand. He didn't meet my gaze, but I could hear him breathing heavily like he had been running. Neither of us said anything for a long moment. Both of us seemed to be trying to get used to the fact that Wilson had just walked off like that.

 

I wasn't sure how long we stood in silence and stillness, but eventually, Webber threw his knife towards the empty fire pit, the end sticking in the ground. Without a word, he picked up a handful of dying leaves and twigs and threw it into the ring of rocks. I just watched as he began to set up the fire.

 

Finally, the silence was broken. “You shouldn't have done that,” Webber said heavily. “Now what will we do?” Without pulling the knife out of the ground, he grabbed the hilt of it.

 

“JUST WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE.”

 

“Just without Wilson,” he added quietly.

 

For a moment, the only sounds were the crackling of the newborn fire.

 

“Why did you do that?” He asked, staring into the fire.

 

I had no reply. I had no idea why I went off at Wilson. I wasn't sure if I was just very mad or if it was a side effect of the temporary short-circuit or what. Not that I would let him know of my confusion. “HE WAS A BURDEN.”

 

“You're a burden,” he mumbled.

 

“I DON'T NEED YOU EITHER,” I informed him. “I COULD LIVE JUST FINE BY MYSELF.”

 

Webber finally looked up from the fire, a wry grin on his face. “Well, why don't you do that then? Oh wait, let us guess. Some pathetic excuse about you being super nice and awesome and looking after the little kid?” His voice hardened, as though his shock was gradually turning into anger, and he stood to face me. “Guess what, WX? We've survived on our own before. You haven't. You need us. We- however- don't need you.”

 

“I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED YET BUT THIS ISN'T EXACTLY EARTH.”

 

“You guys keep saying that word. What does it even mean?” He crossed his arms.

 

I puzzled for a moment over what word he was talking about. “EARTH?”

 

“Yes!”

 

“YOU'RE AN IDIOT.”

 

He looked offended. "Look, it doesn't matter. See- see this?" He parted his fur around his knuckles and held it out for me to examine. A trio of long, deep scars was marked across them. "Those scars? Yeah. We got those from living out here. And this?" He showed off another scar on his shoulder. "This too. So yes, we are very serious about living out in this world by ourself. So, you can stay or you can prove your stupidity by leaving."

 

“IT'S NOT STUPIDITY. IT'S STRENGTH.”

 

“Is that what they're calling it now?” He sounded mockingly thoughtful. His clawed fingers twitched as though he was really in the mood to claw me in the face. I clenched my fist. If he lashed out at me, his claws would barely do anything against my metal skin. Plus, I'd be perfectly justified in punching him back. I almost wanted him to try. “Either way, paperweight, it's your choice.”

 

He looked so smug. It made me want to punch him even more. Refusing to satisfy him with a response, I walked past him and to the fire. Webber laughed in a way that sounded crueler than anything. "Coward! Afraid to deal with the big bad world all by your little lonesome?" I grabbed my bag and weapon, my 'eyes' closed. When I finally opened them again and looked back, I saw that his teeth were bared in a sneer.

 

I graced him with one final action. The hardest punch I could muster right in the lower jaw before stalking away, giving no final words. I assumed that the previous damage done to the boy's jaw had weakened it without much proper time to heal, and the renewed blunt force had broken open old wounds, mainly judging by the audible crack and the fact that the second I hit him he doubled over in pain. I didn't care anymore. He made his choices and I made mine.

 

Even if he wanted to he probably couldn't have shouted anything at me, and even though I refused to look back I could feel his ice cold glare burning into my back. He was so certain that he could survive on his own- so certain that he was the best of us three- I was desperate to prove him wrong.

 

Even if that meant leaving him for dead.

 

It was quite an amusing yet depressing though at the same time, the latter most likely due to the fact that that would mean I wouldn't be able to watch his certain demise. Whatever. It didn't matter I would probably stumble across his dead body anyway.

 

Somehow that didn't seem to help matters much.

 

Naturally, my first instinct was to try to find Wilson again, but my mind instantly shot that down. He was most likely still mad after I had driven him out, and he needed time to cool down before I tried to talk to him again. Which, of course, left only one viable course of action- trying to make it by myself. Which surely wouldn't be too hard for a robot of my build. I couldn't help but puff out my chest a little, feeling almost proud. No world was too strong for me to handle! I was a loner! I didn't need anyone else!

 

Of course, that would be the very time everything would go downhill.

 

There was a hill that Wilson had talked about going over when winter first started. It connected the pine forest and the rocky land beyond. I, in my high-and-mighty state of mind, made the very same mistake that Wilson had made that nearly landed him with a mangled leg.

 

I wasn't listening.

 

Instead of an obvious hollow thump that signified the arrival of a giant, it was a different kind of footstep- my own. I had noticed that the ground had felt slightly different but I thought little of it. If I had been paying attention, I would've noticed the way that my footsteps echoed instead of being absorbed into the ground. In barely a second I went from feeling like I was on top of the world to falling.

 

The ground caved in beneath me, unable to support my weight like it had Wilson's. For a moment I was certain I was about to die. The floor below me- if there was any at all- was hidden away in shadow, so hitting it was about as sudden and jarring as you could get. I was temporarily paralyzed by the impact, but slowly I regained sensation in my limbs. Sitting up was painful. I had just managed to lift my arm to try to stand when something caught my eye. I completely froze, hoping whatever it was would go away. Whatever it was shrunk and disappeared for a moment before reappearing, and I realized what they were.

 

Eyes.

 

Someone, or something, was watching me. Now determined to not show weakness to the strange monster, I forced myself to my feet, ignoring the pain and wobbliness and the fact that my knees refused to lock into a standing position. I glared in the direction of the eyes, and I got a better look at them. They were big and round, and a shade of red that looked closer to pink. After a moment of basically having a staring contest with them, another pair of eyes, a deeper red this time, appeared next to the first. This creature was holding a sort of berry in its mouth that glowed, showing its face and giving it an almost creepy glow. From what I saw, the creature was spider-like and white, but that's all I could really make out. The spider took a few steps closer to me before dropping the berry and scampering back into the darkness.

 

My gaze flicked to it and back at the eyes. They just seemed to be... waiting. For what? I couldn't tell, but I definitely was not eating that berry. I glanced up but it appeared that I wasn't going to be able to escape that way. The creature with the pink eyes hissed something at me, and I couldn't help but flinch. Apparently, both of the red-eyed creature and the pink-eyed creature were spiders. Interesting. I wasn't entirely sure of how much time had passed before the spiders retreated, never once attempting to get closer to me or try to communicate again. By now, the sun had been gone for quite some time and the only thing keeping me from getting slaughtered by the beast in the dark was the strangely glowing berry at my feet. It wasn't much, but it was enough. Cautiously, I bent down to hold the fruit.

 

I looked beyond the cave, my mind working hard as it tried to find a way out of this mess. Going back up from where I fell from was out of the question, considering that the entrance was far above my head. I wasn't too fond of exploring the cave by myself, so my train of thought went right to 'wait for a rescue'.

 

Ahh, nope. That probably wasn't going to work either. Most likely, Wilson thought I was still with Webber, and Webber probably thought that I went to find Wilson. I slowly lowered myself into a sitting position. Even if they didn't think that what would make them want to try to rescue me in the first place.

 

They would never look for me.

 

I brought my knees up, resting my chin on them. There was a strange feeling inching its way up my spine. Some sort of emotion that I could not properly comprehend. I had a sneaking suspicion that I knew what it was, but some part of me wanted to deny it.

 

Guilt.

 

I felt bad.

 

Robots couldn't cry, that was a proven fact. It was scientifically impossible even if some sort of mechanism was implemented to allow it. But at that moment, that guilt pressing at me like that, I felt closer to tears than I had ever felt. Stop that. It's the darkness getting to you, I told myself furiously, but no matter how many times I told myself that, I knew it wasn't true. I hated being alone. I hated others but I hated being alone more. The lonely feeling of solitude... it wasn't something I could deal with for long.

 

“The biggest mistake I made in your creation I'm sure.” I nearly cried out at the venomous voice behind me. I jumped into a standing position, all of my aches gone as pure terror flooded my senses. No longer was I in a dark cave with no light, and no longer was I alone. The floor, ceilings, and walls were made of an eerily clean white tile, and the... the... thing in front of me brought back far too many memories. I quickly backed away, trying to escape but my back quickly connected with a wall. It (the monster was far too terrible to be referred to as he or she) chuckled softly as though noticing my sudden and intense fear. "I was right about you all along, wasn't I?"

 

“NO...” I managed to hiss. It looked faintly amused. “YOU'RE... YOU'RE NOT HERE. YOU CAN'T BE.”

 

“Oh good, you figured it out yourself. I was afraid I would have to explain the concept of a conscience to you as well.”

 

“WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?” I took advantage of a millisecond of bravery to take a step forward.

 

“The real question is, what do you want from me?” Its voice had a way of sticking into my head, tainting every thought with the fear of death or suffering. “After all, what more could I want?” There was a pause that I did not deem it necessary to say anything or talk back at all. Two massive metal claws descended from the ceiling. The panic instantly set in.

 

Those claws grabbing me and lifting me by the shoulders.

 

The sound of metal hitting metal as they crushed me, little by little

 

No!

 

But this time, they were not empty. They held no intent on smashing me or damaging me this time. In fact, they dropped two, fairly large objects on the floor in front of me before retreating. I stared at the two objects in a continued silence. One, the more disturbing one, appeared to be an eyeball, my size or even bigger, without an eyes socket to contain it. The other was a pale, rounded shape with tiny sparks of electricity jumping around on its surface. It- my creator- motioned to the two objects, and I slowly began to piece the clues together.

 

“THE... THE EYE OF THE DEERCLOPS AND EGG OF THE Goose? HOW...? WHY...?”

 

It fixed me with that glowing orange glare for so long I began to get uncomfortable. “You'll understand soon. But for now, you have something to do.”

 

I opened my mouth to ask what but before I could I had been thrown out of the strange vision. I looked down at my hands and saw them shaking like crazy. That was why I was here. Because anything was better than that place. I was more cared about here than I ever was there, no matter how much they hated me. Nothing could ever surpass the hatred it felt for me.

 

I had to live with being the biggest mistake ever created in its eyes.

 

I was a failure.

 

A flaw.

 

But that wasn't me anymore. I wasn't there anymore. I straightened myself. I was a survivor. No more were the days where death was constantly lurking over my head. No more were the moments when I feared that I would collapse and never boot up again.

 

But I had a job to do.

 

And it was time to do it. Silence. Sweet, sweet silence. For the longest time, all that we ever wanted was someone else to talk to, but now that we had it we just wanted them to stop. We basked in the lack of noise for the first few minutes, but eventually, it got eerie. The chill of winter had driven insects and birds and animals away, so no noise drifted through the air at all. Our ears rang. Weariness began to set in. Usually, this was the point we would try to make some sort of small talk, but there was no one left to talk to. What we said about living in the wild by ourself for a time was very true, but the season of being near others had softened us.

 

We were pathetic now.

 

We shook our head, a soft growl rising in our throat. We had to prove we could survive without them. We could survive without them... right? Of course, the scoffing reply echoed through our mind. You're being ridiculous with your... self-doubt. You know very well you don't need them to survive. They need you. When they realize that... they'll come crawling back.

 

For a reason that had nothing to do with being cold, we shivered. Where the dark thoughts had come from was far beyond our knowledge. We thought briefly back to the memories of playing in the white, powdery snow and vaguely remembered being innocent. Time had been cruel to us, though, so by now, this innocence had long since fled us. Yes, but that innocence has given way to strength... and speed... your intelligence can use some work though.

 

Ah, gee, thanks, insulted by my own mind. Flattered.

 

Are you really so gullible?

 

We closed our eyes and laughed lightly, wryly. Alone for barely an hour and we had already resorted to arguing with ourself? What was the point? Eyes still closed, we bared our teeth. We just need to get our mind off of... things. Telling ourself this was no hardship, but for some reason standing up seemed a much harder task than it used to be.

 

Relax. Go out. Get a breath of fresh air. Clear your mind.

 

Relax, Webber.

 

Breathe.

 

We took a moment to recompose ourself, flexing and unflexing our claws in an attempt to relieve some of the tension built up in them. We couldn't stop working. We could hardly believe how cold it had suddenly gotten. We need fire- or warmth of some kind. We tried to keep from shivering as we slowly dragged our gaze across the snowy and barren landscape. Yes. Out. Out for supplies and... to clear your mind. We briefly thought of the tree guard followed by the bout of insanity, and we dropped our gaze to our feet. Were we really strong enough to stay out here ourself? It hadn't even been a week before we had been crippled by that blasted tree monster, and we didn't have any clue as to how long it took for insanity to kick in. But hadn't they taken care of us both of those times? Weren't they really the reason we were still alive?

 

Of course not, that slightly familiar voice scoffed. You survived by yourself... well, not quite by yourself.

 

What do you mean?

 

We had each other, didn't we?

 

A chill, more fierce than any other chill we had encountered, racked through our body. Is... is that who you are?

 

Proudly.

 

Oh. As though the realization drained us of our remaining energy, we completely gave up the idea of going out and opted to just let our knees buckle right there. The voice scoffed again.

 

You know, lying there isn't going to do anything, except for maybe get both of us killed. And it'd be a shame if that happened.

 

We slowly picked ourself up again, listening intently for the voice to speak up again but to no avail. It must have been a figment of our imagination. Again. Argh, we won't be able to do anything if we fell insane again.

 

We say as though it's a disease, which it might as well be now. Without thinking about it, we began to move forward, towards the forest. We need to build something to keep us warm and... our stomach growled. We need food too... can you help us with that?

 

Part of us wanted to see if that was all imagined, and judging by the lack of response, it probably was. We forced ourself to raise our chin and puff out our chest a little bit. As though if we convinced ourself that we were strong without them we would be.

 

We weren't sure exactly how long we had been walking before we had really started to freeze. Our fingers were numb, and the numbness was quickly spreading to our hands and legs. We paused for a moment to breathe warm air into our palms before squinting and looking around. Our mind had been so focused on the freezing air that we didn't even consider where we were going, and it was pretty safe to say we were totally lost. Confused, we turned on our heel to consider the surrounding area. Over there it appears the forest thins out... maybe we could figure out where we are better where we can see better. Deciding this was the best course of action- admittedly because it was the only one we could think of- we made our way towards the thinner trees.

 

Much like our encounter with the tree guard and Wilson's encounter with the Bearger, we didn't pay attention to the obvious signs ahead of us. The sudden stench, for one, should have been a clear sign not to go that way, but our mind was so much in the distance that we didn't comprehend it until we were face-to-face with one of the scariest things we had ever seen.

 

Skeletons.

 

Lots of skeletons.

 

Almost every single one a human skeleton.

 

We instantly recoiled, all previous thoughts fleeing our mind in favor of sheer terror. Those were obviously human skeletons, the bones stripped clean of any flesh but the stench of decay was still there. For some reason, though, the skeletons themselves were not what scared us the most. It was the idea that there had been others here, and they failed. We were frozen. Part of us wanted to run for the hills, get away from this horrid place as fast as possible. The other half of us- the... 'better half'... of us- was deeply curious as to what struck these other survivors down.

 

We edged closer to the sight. It appeared there were two full skeletons, both locked in positions of agony, and a scattering of bones that suggested at least another that had been smashed by something. Feeling a little sick, we forced ourself to examine the area even closer, and our eyes caught on something we hadn't seen previously. One of the mossy boulders on the forest floor was, in fact, not a boulder. It appeared that was due to its grayed out color and very mossy covering, but further inspection revealed it to be another skeleton, this one obviously not human. Just the head was thrice our size, and just the sight of it brought back a familiar pain of having a clouded mind and aching head.

 

No no no not doing this again. Panic was trying to settle in, but we forced ourself to back away. Our legs didn't want to move, partially from being paralyzed by fear and partially since the cold had stripped them of much sensation. It was almost unexpected when the terrified signals from our head finally reached the rest of our body and we fled as fast as our legs could possibly move. Trying to take shallow breaths while still getting enough air was difficult enough, let alone the added difficulty of keeping our vision straight ahead. We saw the land fall away in front of us just as our energy began to fail. Just over this hill... just over this hill and we can relax.

 

Turns out it wasn't a hill.

 

The second we reached the crest of it, we noticed our mistake and slowed to a halt. There was no land there. Just like every other time we had run as fast as possible, we had ended face-to-face with the ocean.

 

How are we supposed to run if there's always a cliff in the way!? We took a step back, our senses gradually slowing to normal speed. The waves crashing against the rocky cliff seemed to whisper our name, but before we could get any farther back when a hand rested against our back. We were in mid turn to see who it was- perhaps Wilson or WX came back for us!-

 

Only for that very hand to push us forward.

 

A shout had already erupted from our mouth and the rocks echoed with it by the time we figured out exactly what had happened.

 

The next second we hit the water belly-first.

 

It certainly wasn't the first time we had gone into the ocean- we thought of the Deerclops with a shiver- but it seemed much more shocking this time around, probably due to the fact that tiny sheets of ice had began to freeze bits of water and hitting them drove needle-sharp icicles into our skin. On our own for less than a day... the tiny voice in the back of our head chimed. And already the battle has been lost.

 

…

 

We weren't sure how long it had been before we felt something solid beneath us.

 

We weren't certain how we had survived, nor what those voices in the background were saying let alone who they belonged to...

 

It wasn't until a claw sat on our shoulder for a good minute until we realized we weren't dead.

 

Dripping and shivering violently as the water clinging to our fur began to freeze into clumps, we barely managed to open our eyes to glare at the creature that dare disturb our sleep.

 

It was a spider.

 

Just... an ordinary spider... that for some reason made the shivers even more violent and our breath catch in our throat. The spider graced us with a pleasantly vicious grin, and waited until we were fully aware again to speak.

 

“You've been out for quite awhile,” it said in a sneering tone. “Too much water for you?”
 

“Who... who are you?”

 

“A friend! An acquaintance! A-well, should I drop the act?” The spider slowly paced around us, examining every dripping fur, ever healed over scar across our body. “I'm part of you, my friend. I'm... sure, you haven't forgotten me.”

 

Our mind still wasn't working the best, and it rolled its eyes at our obviously clueless look. “Have you forgotten already?”

 

Oh.

 

Right.

 

Him.

 

“What do you want from me?” I rasped.

 

“A lot of things, but you don't understand. I'm here to help you.” Something tinted our senses, something strong and metallic and warm, but when we turned to look at it, it reached out its claw and pressed it against our cheek to stop us from doing so. “Your.... 'friends'... will be experiencing something similar, so don't be too scared, human.” It stepped away, silencing itself as it probably waited for us to turn and see the thing it stopped us from seeing the first time.

 

As if the day hadn't been terrifying enough, the sight was somehow even more unexpected and... horrible... then all of the others of that day.

 

Two items were on the ground in front of us: A bloody horn and a tooth sitting in a rivulet of some glowing orange liquid, possibly lava.

 

And there were two bodies beyond them.

 

Two.

 

A robot's and a scientist's.

 

No.

 

The claw rested on our back, digging slightly into our flesh as to appear as though it was offering comfort but truly hurting us, but we didn't even feel the pain. We were too busy staring at those two bodies.

 

The horn was in front of WX's. A large hole had been torn out of the robot's torso. If the wound had been any bigger, he would have been in danger of being split in half by the severity of it.

 

The tooth was in front of Wilson's. A set of three bloody claw marks had been ripped down his chest, his clothing stained an even darker red and blood still pulsed from it.

 

We held our head as tears threatened to spill into our vision. Stop it.. you're stronger than that. They mean nothing to you.

 

But we can't... no...

 

"They're not dead," I whispered, hoping to hear the spider agree to confirm it, but the claw simply withdrew and when we risked a glance at it, it appeared to simply shrug.

 

"I would know as much as you, human." It raised another one of its front claws, examining it just as blood from nowhere began to drip down it. "But you'd better find them quickly, or else... heh, well, I'm not completely sure. All I know..." It paused for a moment, as though trying to think or trying to create tension. "Is that either way, you and I will have fun together... forever." Turns out, Winter was very cold.

 

It was even colder when you were alone away from a fire or any other source of warmth.

 

I blew heart into my already freezing hands and rubbed them together as I trudged along, trying to drive the shivers away from my vulnerable frame. Some part of me was greatly regretting leaving like that, but if I was honest with myself I wasn't completely certain Webber wasn't about to tackle me. And despite the fact he was almost half my size, he was also half spider with claws and teeth and I had nothing like that, so he probably would have had the upper hand.

 

Shivers of fear joined the pre-existing shivers on my arms, and I closed my eyes and forced myself to take a deep breath. I was imagining something that didn't happen- that would never happen. The fact I was imagining being mauled by a seven-year-old only cemented the fact that I was being completely ridiculous.

 

What I wasn't being ridiculous about was that I could very easily die out here. I squinted at the sky. I wasn't completely sure how long I had been wandering around, but it must have been long enough. The skyline on one horizon was orangish pink with the sunset. Even as I stood I could hear the sounds of birds and other animals becoming quieter and quieter. I slowly dropped my eyes to my feet. I wanted to go back so badly. I wanted to go back and sit next to the fire and watch Webber and WX argue and relax.

 

If I go back now, they'll team up on me, I thought wryly. Even if I could take on and defeat Webber by myself, there is no way I could defend myself against both him and WX.

 

And that'd be admitting defeat! They'll see that I don't need them!

 

But what if they need you? A tiny voice pointed out. Then it's their own fault for chasing me away, I thought back furiously. I nodded to myself and looked around the forest, searching for something to make a fire big enough to survive the long winter night and chase away the cold that had settled into my bones.

 

By the time night had fully fallen, I had managed to get a small fire going. It wasn't much, it probably wasn't enough, but it was something at least. I couldn't let myself fall asleep, the fire was just too weak to allow me to stop caring about it for a minute. It was admittedly hard though... mainly due to the fact it was so cold and being near the fire made me warm, and it was like a blanket, hiding me from the darkness, surrounding me, blanketing me, encouraging me to relax...

 

No! Stay awake, Wilson! Stay awake!

 

The sky happily obliged in helping and gentle flakes of snow began to drift down from the sky. They landed softly, without a sound, a silent killer hidden cheerfully behind a mask of frost. I frowned at the fire. Just a little longer. Just stay awake a little longer... if you fall asleep this fire will go out and you WILL freeze to death. Or get killed by the Night Monster. Or some other terrible fate I can't think of right now.

 

Daytime was a long time coming. A long, exhausting, time coming. But it finally did come, and when it did the fire was still alive. First thing's first, I need to find a way to keep myself awake.

 

My mind instantly turned my feet to the side, and I wondered for a moment why. Oh, right, the frog ponds.. maybe a little cold water would help.

 

I didn't want to waste the precious fire though. This was the only thing that stopped me from moving that very second. Hesitantly, I grabbed some fairly thick and sturdy branch from nearby and let it hover in the fire for a moment until it caught. I was careful not to move it too quickly as to kill the newly born flame, but the fire took to the wood much better than it took to the damp grass, and it stayed steady. I shoved the hand not holding the torch into a pocket and puffed my chest out.

 

I wasn't that easy to take out.

 

I wasn't that easy to take out!

 

Filled with rather forced determination, I set off towards the ponds. The snowfall from the night before had become heavier, and as I walked the heaviness only increased. I paused, squinting through the snow as it stung my eyes. I need to get to shelter first... the chill was enough to wake me up finally, but that was no longer something I cared about. The wind was picking up as the snowfall tried to turn into a full-on blizzard.

 

And yet... below the sound of the howling wind... below the sound of my panicked heartbeat...

 

Was that coughing?

 

I frowned and kept my gaze low, trying desperately to keep the snow out of my eyes. It didn't matter if that was someone coughing. They were probably going to die anyway, just as I was. The sound soon disappeared, and I assured myself it was just a figment of my sleep-deprived imagination. In the corners of my eyes, something black whizzed past my vision, and I glanced up.

 

Naturally, this was a mistake.

 

Along with the blast of ice-cold snow whipping me in the face, something suddenly wrapped itself around my ankles, and before I could struggle to get them off I tripped, hitting the ground awkwardly. It wasn't a hard landing, but it was a cold landing. The shadows around my feet retreated, and they swirled together vertically in a pillar for a moment.

 

Is this what dying is like? Is this me hallucinating? Will those shadows turn into something to escort me to the afterlife?

 

The figure, however, was not at all familiar. I could make it out as being tall and thin, but its silhouette didn't give any indication to any other features. The shadows drew away, just leaving me and the silhouette.

 

I didn't even notice that it had stopped snowing in a perfect circle around us, and the blizzard raged on around us.

 

It slowly walked towards me and offered a hand. I was still breathing heavily due to the exertion of pushing through the blizzard for so long, but I took it anyway and it pulled me to my feet.

 

Its hand was cold and slippery, almost slimy.

 

“You seemed to have fallen,” the figure commented. Its voice was impossible to describe or comprehend, but if I had to, I would explain it as 'feminine yet masculine, deep yet high-pitched, cheerful yet filled with hatred'.

 

“Yeah... thanks for helping me up.” I narrowed my eyes, trying to put out distinguishing features. “Who... are you?”

 

The figure shrugged a movement that sent ripples all down its incorporeal body. “No one important to you... yet.”

 

“Yet?”

 

“Let's just say we aren't supposed to meet until much, much later.”

 

“Wait...” I took a few panicked steps back, trying to put the pieces together. I wasn't even cold anymore... like the presence of the figure eliminated everything deadly. “Maxwell...?” I didn't even mean for my voice to sound so hostile, but the thought of that arrogant grin resting on me again made me want to punch the nearest living thing.

 

It laughed. “No, no. Maxwell is... the master.”

 

“Master? You're one of Maxwell's creations?”

 

“I existed long before the master,” it circled me, its body warping and shifting unnaturally. “You are lost?”

 

“I-I guess you could say that.”

 

“You are alone as well... I could have sworn you had more people.” It paused. “They are lost as well.”

 

“Lost? No, they're back at camp.” I frowned. “What do you want from me?”

 

“I want to assist you.” It waved its arm, a tuft of silver-black fur suddenly appearing in its palm. I cautiously reached out to grab it and shivered at the oily texture. “The fur of the beast mortals like yourself call the Bearger,” it announced. “One of the five items needed for your escape.”

 

“One of? What are the other four?”

 

“Your friends know the answer,” it replied simply. Behind the figure, more of the blizzard lifted to reveal a pathway... a clear pathway. “Go to them. They understand now that you need each other.”

 

I was left with my mouth half-open. “Wait! How would they understand!” I looked back at it, and it was gone. No! “What is your name!? Who are you!?”

 

The edges of my vision darkened as the same voice echoed through my mind, accompanied by the incredibly loud and piercing sound of tinnitus. “I am the demon that comes when you call its name...

 

I am your greatest Nightmare.” We could hear a storm raging above us. The sprawling cave system beneath the surface echoed with the gale winds, and every once in awhile we'd stumble across a snowdrift that had sneaked in from the surface. Naturally, we numbly ignored them, still partially frozen from the Ocean's icy water and still terribly shaken from the encounters with the skeleton and... him. Every time we closed our eyes we saw those two mangled corpses. Every time a drop of melted frost dripped from the ceiling and landed on us our mind instantly saw it as blood.

 

The guilt was by far the worst part.

 

The guilt of chasing them away because we were angry.

 

The guilt that we might cause their deaths.

 

Worst of all...

 

The guilt of making them think we didn't need them.

 

We needed them. We needed each other. We looked up at a crack of pale light from above, shining down on barren rock. We had been walking through a field of light-producing flowers for... most likely all day now. It hadn't gotten any warmer as the day progressed, but it hadn't gotten much colder either. In fact, it was probably safer down here than it was up there. It didn't really help our situation much considering but at least we knew it could've been worse. The light from the flowers kept us safe from the darkness, but it illuminated our poor condition all too well, namely the shards of ice frozen to our fur and whiskers. We almost unconsciously ran our claws through the clumps, as though trying to be presentable again. We allowed our eyelids to droop shut, walking without really looking where we were going. If we walked into the darkness who really would care? Nobody would even notice we were gone...

 

Perhaps it was pure luck? Or maybe there was some greater force watching over us that day, although that was something that, in our mind, had been debunked thousands and thousands of times. No matter the reason, destiny saw our predicament, our readiness to die.

 

And whatever the reason, destiny just wouldn't have it.

 

Maybe it had been hours, maybe days. Or maybe, it was only a few minutes, but after some time of walking alone in that field of glowing berries, we happened upon the greatest stroke of luck that we had ever had upon entering this part of the world.

 

We happened upon WX.

 

Which, perhaps, probably shouldn't have seemed like such good luck, but we saw each other from afar. We didn't question how he got here. We didn't question why we were so happy to see him. We didn't question anything. Before we even knew what we were doing he was right in front of us and we literally hugged him. He let out a faint noise of protest, perhaps a mixture of disgust and shock as well, and shoved us away, looking fierce.

 

Though... did we see our relief mirrored in his eyeless gaze?

 

“SO, YOU DID FAIL.”

 

Oh, right, now we remembered why we yelled at him in the first place. Feeling guilty again, we looked away.

 

“THAT'S SURPRISING, HONESTLY. YOU NOT DENYING THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T SURVIVE WITHOUT US, THAT IS.”

 

“You don't have to berate us...” I responded quietly, still feeling faint with glee. “We know what we did was stupid, you don't have to tell us.”

 

How in the world did he manage to look even smugger?

 

“You're in the same situation, aren't you?!”

 

“WELL,” he spread his arms and motioned to the field, looking the slightest bit helpless. “IT APPEARS SO.”

 

“Were you really going to try to lecture us on something you did as well?”

 

For a moment he was silent, examining every inch of our frost-clumped fur and every ice-tipped hair. “AT LEAST I DIDN'T NEARLY FREEZE TO DEATH ON THE WAY DOWN,” he pointed out.

 

“You obviously didn't have such a graceful descent.” We looked pointedly at his shoulder, which looked like it had been smashed, most likely when he fell.

 

He narrowed his 'eyes'. “DID I NOT HIT YOU HARD ENOUGH TO BREAK YOUR JAW LAST TIME?”

 

“Already on the threats? Can't we wait to try to kill each other until we're, you know, not each other's only hopes of survival?”

 

He sighed, one of those 'that's a good point but I don't want to admit it' sighs.

 

“As soon as we get back you can make all of the scary faces you want,” I promised, smiling pleasantly.

 

“AND FIND WILSON,” he insisted.

 

We tipped our head. “Wilson won't want to come back,” I scoffed. “He's too confident in his own powers. Moron, he's going to get himself killed...” Our voice faded out as the 'know-it-all' look became more and more apparent on the robot's face. “Don't you-”

 

“YOU DO REALIZE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE DOING.” WX crossed his arms. “I DON'T THINK HE'LL BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT US. IT'D BE A PITY TO STUMBLE ACROSS HIS CORPSE.” Despite his fairly harsh words, actual hints of concern crept into his expression. He cares, he just really, really, really hates showing it.

 

We can understand that...

 

“Well anyway, standing around here doing nothing isn't going to help. What do you suggest?”

 

"THERE'S NOTHING THAT WAY," he started, pointing at where he came from. "EXCEPT FOR A HOLE VERY VERY VERY HIGH UP. AND UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOME USEFUL SPIDER TRAITS LIKE CLIMBING THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN GET UP THERE." He promptly grabbed the nearest light fruit from its plant and took a bite of it. "AND IF WE GO ANYWHERE ELSE THE FIELD ENDS." He was silent for a moment before adding quietly, "AND I AM NOT CERTAIN YOU CAN LAST MUCH LONGER WITHOUT A FIRE..."

 

“We'll be fine,” I insisted, suddenly worried that even he noticed that we were off. How bad is it really?

 

Another flash in our mind: crimson blood, loose bolts, crying, screaming.

 

“WHATEVER YOU SAY... BUT IF YOU SUDDENLY DROP I'M NOT COMING BACK FOR YOU.” We couldn't tell if he was joking or not.

 

“If you suddenly drop it'll be us holding the knife,” I quipped without even thinking about it. He looked almost amused for a moment before he started heading to our right, where the field seemed to go on.
 

“COME ON, LET'S FIND A WAY OUT OF HERE.”

 

We continued walking, just like before. Unlike before, though, we weren't alone, and although WX himself was as cold as the stone we walked on we didn't care. We didn't need him for warmth, we needed him because we felt weak without him. We lapsed into silence, neither of us having a reason to say anything and, at least for us, the concern of another cave-in was heavy on our mind.

 

Speaking of which, destiny decided that today wasn't fulfilling enough so it stepped in again. This time, it made itself known once more with a bang.

 

Or, a clatter more like. A clatter of rocks falling from the ceiling. Both of our gazes snapped to the roof at once, the idea of a cave-in suddenly becoming more of a reality. Fate was being nice this time around, though.

 

Only a small circular portion of the ceiling fell away, a giant heap of snow falling into the newly created hole as well.

 

In the meanwhile, we heard some sort of... grumbling noise in the distance.

 

In the circle of light produced by the hole, a shadow appeared. A very unbelievable and very familiar shadow. “WHAT...?”

 

“Heyyyy Wilson, we were just talking about you!” We called up to the man, who looked more confused than ever.

 

“The shadow creep was right!” He shouted back, beaming. WX had his face buried and was muttering something along the lines of 'this can't be happening'.

 

"Let us guess! Your friends are in danger and/or dying and/or dead!"

 

“And they're right here,” Wilson added sheepishly. “But yes, you're right as well. What are the odds!?”

 

We exchanged a glance with WX before returning his grin. “So, you know how you're up there and we're not?”

 

He laughed to himself, a sound that echoed through the caves almost endlessly. “I get it, you knuckleheads. I didn't realize it'd be so far down...it's too far for a vine or a branch or anything...”

 

We tipped our head, listening to that growling sound growing a bit louder.

 

“NO ROPE?”

 

“Too far.” He shook his head and disappeared for a moment, probably trying to wrack his brain.

 

Around that time is when the first worm attacked. It was so sudden, so uncalled for, that the enormous creature rising out of the ground was enough to send us flinching so hard we nearly fell over. Dark fur covered its entire, long body is purple and midnight-blue stripes, and jagged teeth were everywhere in its gaping maw as it roared to the ceiling and dove back underground.

 

We were getting very tired of panicking at this point.

 

There was a pause when everything was quiet again before the worm surged upward again, one of its dagger-like teeth scraping our abdomen as it moved just passed us. We growled. The wound already stung but it wasn't anything compared to some of the things we already had to deal with.

 

Wilson continued to watch from above, his gray eyes becoming more and more concerned with every passing moment. His eyes widened and he disappeared from view once more, but we were too busy trying to dodge the worm to really notice. When he reappeared, he had the 'I'm-about-to-do-something-really-stupid' expression. “Use the worm to get up here!” He called after a moment's consideration.

 

“What!? Are you insane!?”

 

“When it comes up grab the stem on its forehead!” He called back. “It might be the only way!”

 

“YOU'RE CRAZY!” WX protested, but before he could complain very long the hit him with its tail so hard he fell and slid a few feet.

 

He was right. That might be the only way.

 

Putting on a brave face, we narrowed our eyes. “Are you alright?”

 

"I'M FINE," WX insisted, getting back to his feet and looking angrier than ever.

 

“Then follow my lead.” Before he could protest again, the worm resurfaced. The very second its head rose from the ground we were moving, and then we were on its head, holding onto the plant stem sprouting from its head. And then, once again, before we knew it we were on the surface again with the help of Wilson. We were more than content to sit on our hands and knees and breathe.

 

Before we had even finished catching our breath WX had joined us on the surface, looking just as shaken as we felt. And of course, just like he always had been, Wilson was crouched at our side, concern etched into his face as he gently patted our back. We didn't say anything- we couldn't in fear of just collapsing right there, but we smiled at him. The most legitimate smile we could manage, and we could see it in his eyes. That's all he wanted. That's all he needed. Finally, we managed to get enough of our strength back to surprise hug him, and he didn't hesitate to hug us back. “Thank you,” I whispered. “Thank you...” The bitter cold of winter seemed far away now. The muffled chirps of snowy blue birds that lived in the barren landscape were the only thing that broken the uncomfortable silence.

 

Well, that and the sound of the fire crackling nearby. It was strange how much the sound came as a relief to us. It didn't even occur to us before that we didn't have any hope to hear it again. Gradually, our senses returned, and we became acutely aware of how, despite the heat that was heavy in our fur, there was an underlying chill we could not shake off. We stretched, uncurling from the ball we didn't know we had curled into. Wilson, disturbed by the movement, glanced down at us and smiled. We instantly felt our cheeks flush with embarrassment, but the fact that we had essentially cuddled up to him all night for warmth was not brought up at all. A moment of silence passed before he turned back to the fire. We stifled a sneeze and blinked up at him, even though he wasn't looking at us anymore. Finally, we couldn't hold it in anymore and sneezed anyway, a small and childish sound which definitely did not help our pride in this situation at all.

 

“You just can't keep yourself out of trouble, can you?” Wilson chuckled. “I've never know anyone more prone to the elements than you are.”

 

We looked away, burning with shame.

 

“It's... not hypothermia, right?”

 

He shrugged. “I'm pretty sure you just got a cold. Which isn't surprising, considering you were soaking wet in the middle of winter away from the sun for who-knows-how-long. What did you even do to get so wet? Take a swim?”

 

“That's... closer to the truth than you'd probably think,” I admitted ruefully.

 

He quickly gave us an alarmed look.

 

“We were pushed,” I added quickly, not wanting to seem even stupider than we already did. “by a shadow.” Should've left that out...

 

Instead of laughing or making fun of us for believing a shadow could do such a thing, a deep frown replaced his smile. He opened his mouth to say something when one of the frozen bushes crackled and WX pushed his way out of the undergrowth, wearing a similar stern expression. “WE WEREN'T FOLLOWED,” he said. He looked a bit worse for wear but considering the circumstances, it could've have ended much worse. For any of us.

 

Wilson nodded, his gaze remote for a moment before clearing. “I saw a shadow,” he murmured after a moment.

 

WX scoffed as he sat beside the fire.

 

“It wasn't an ordinary shadow though. It...” he took a deep breath. “It talked to me.”

 

WX perked up at this, as did we. “WHAT DID IT SAY?” WX pressed warily.

 

Wilson looked back at the fire. “It's... probably nothing. Just imagining stuff...”

 

An uncomfortable silence settled over us. We took a deep breath- making a sniffing sound due to congestion from the cold- and sat up a little straighter, bringing our knees to our face and resting our chin on them. “I saw my spider,” I said after a minute. Two shocked gazes turned on us, and we shrank in our own fur.

 

WX tore his gaze away and concentrated on the fire as though some secret message was written in it. “I... I SAW MY CREATOR,” he murmured in a tired tone. We were almost certain we didn't imagine the quiver in his voice.

 

“Okay, wow, I thought my vision was the craziest. What are you talking about, seeing your spider? Like, the one that supposedly ate you?”

We nodded miserably.

 

“I ASSUME THIS MEANS WE ALL SAW THE SAME THING, EXCEPT BEING HAUNTED BY OUR WORST NIGHTMARES,” WX said breezily. How horrible must that be? Being afraid of your only parent? We couldn't... we couldn't bear to hate our parents...

 

“That was what he told me,” I confirmed. “The... seeing the same thing part...”

 

“So is that what we're supposed to do? Kill the abomination that is the Bearger?” Wilson tipped his head.

 

“The Bearger? No, we saw...” our voice faltered. “the tooth of the Dragonfly and the horn of the Ancient Guardian...”

 

There was a pause, before WX added his own. “EGG OF THE Goose AND EYE OF THE DEERCLOPS.”

 

Wilson groaned and put his head in his hands. “Are you serious??? We have to kill all five???”

 

“We couldn't even take on the Deerclops...” We hunched our shoulders sadly. “Guess that means we're stuck here...”

 

“Don't be that way! We can do this!” Wilson looked from us to WX, then back again. His determined expression fell slightly. “Guys?”

 

“IT'S A SUICIDE MISSION,” WX pointed out.

 

“It's not something we have to do right now.” Wilson protested. “We all just got done with a pretty big scare.... but we gotta know if we're going to try or not.”

 

“Why would we? It's suicide either way.”

 

“Maybe? But at least if we go for this it's suicide with a purpose.”

 

“I WOULDN'T MIND NOT HAVING TO ENDURE ONE OF THESE STUPID WINTERS AGAIN,” WX murmured thoughtfully. He motioned towards us. “HE PROBABLY WON'T EVEN LAST UNTIL THE END OF THIS ONE.”

 

We scowled, and judging by the look on Wilson's face, he agreed with WX. “We're stronger than you think we are.”

“TREE GUARD, INSANITY, NEARLY FREEZING TO DEATH...”

 

“Alright, alright, we get it. But we're still alive, aren't we?”

 

“BECAUSE WE'RE PULLING YOUR WEIGHT. DIDN'T YOUR TIME ALONE TEACH YOU THAT?” A spark of tension shot between us as we bunched our muscles, preparing to finish his beating.

 

“That's enough!” Wilson snapped. “The last thing we need is for you guys to fight again or science forbid break us apart again.”

 

We growled softly but sat back again, our claws itching to wipe that smug grin off of WX's face.

 

Wilson pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. “So are we going to do this or not? Do you guys want to take our chances against the world or do you guys want to take out these beasts?”

 

There was a pause as we considered the options. “I think we should go for the giants.”

 

“I THINK YOU'RE BOTH NUTS,” WX grumbled.

 

Wilson looked between us and sighed again. “I have to be the tiebreaker, don't I? Alright.” He flipped his book over- which he had previously beside him- and flipped through its pages. He stopped on the Goose. “Since we've already run into the Deerclops this winter, I don't think we will again. This is our best bet for the first giant. We need to separate her from her nest before we fight her.”

 

“IT'S THE EGG WE NEED,” WX pointed out.

 

“Yeah, but I don't want to fight her and the moslings at the same time.” He paused as though waiting for another question to be asked, but when none was he nodded once and went on: “She's the spring giant, but it's fairly easy to find the remnants of her nest during the other seasons.” He snapped the book shut and stood again, tucking it away under his arm. “So let's go find that nest.”

 

“...now?”

 

“Now.”

 

We growled softly as we forced ourself to stand. Now us and Wilson stood over WX, who leaned back and made a motion that looked oddly like he'd be rolling his eyes if he had any. “NEITHER OF YOU WILL EVER UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH I HATE YOU,” he muttered as he stood up as well.

 

“Great!” Wilson exclaimed as though WX hadn't said anything. “All three of us! Back together again! Beating the elements and soon to be beating the giants!” He turned on his heel and hummed quietly as he marched towards the savanna.

 

We smiled, angling our face downward so they couldn't see or hear as we hummed along to the familiar tune. The blizzard had died sometime before we woke up again, but the snowdrifts left over from it were well over our head. Where it wasn't a snowdrift, it went about as high as our knees. We dropped behind a little, due to being the smallest of the group, but we took it to our advantage. As soon as we knew we were out of their peripheral vision, we slowly grabbed a handful of the snow, which crunched and compacted satisfyingly under our grip. We spent a few more seconds rolling it in our hands a few times before throwing it at Wilson and diving beneath the snow before he could catch us, hyper-aware that our black fur would stand out against the snow like a sore thumb but for once not caring.

 

Wilson jumped at the impact of the snowball and turned quickly as though expecting something terrible to be there. “Webber!” He exclaimed, sounding actually a bit shocked. We peeked over our little hiding place only to get hit in the forehead with a similar snowball. We fell back dramatically, trying hide our laughter under a fit of sneezing. “Has anyone ever told you that you sneeze like a kitten!?” He teased.

 

“We'll show you who sneezes like a kitten!” We lunged forward and threw a handful of loose snow over his head. He quickly stepped back and sneezed as well due to the snowflakes.

 

“ENOUGH FOOLING AROUND,” WX, who had stopped to watch the miniature snowball fight, said sternly. “WE HAVE ACTUAL WORK TO DO.”

 

Wilson simply looked at him for a second before throwing the snowball he had prepared at him.

 

WX backed away a little, trying to brush the sticky snow off of his chest.

 

It's amazing how something as little as snow can make us feel... myself again...

 

We playfully tackled the robot, not any real force behind the action but enough to send him down. Anger flashed in his eyeless gaze and he kicked us away, driving the air from our lungs as he kicked our stomach to send us off of him. We hit the ground on our side, not actually getting hurt but getting the breath knocked out instead. We looked up, our eyes wide with shock at the sudden change of atmosphere. His 'eyes' were wide too as he shakily forced himself to his feet again. “DON'T. DO. THAT.” He growled.

 

We looked down and nodded, not wanting to get into a fight after feeling like a child like that again.

 

Beneath us was a smudge of blood.

 

We took a sharp breath and jumped back. Did he actually hurt us???

 

It wasn't on our fur though, and we weren't hurt as far as we could tell...

 

Wilson frowned and made his way through the snow to look at it. He hesitated, then carefully dug around it. Our heart began to slow as his digging revealed that it was not blood, but it was the color of blood.

 

He pulled the object away from the snow and brushed remaining flakes off of it, turning it over in his hands a few times. “What... is this thing?”

 

“SMART. FIND A WEIRD THING IN THE SNOW AND PICK IT UP. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT BEING OUT HERE THIS LONG TAUGHT US,” WX huffed, his arms crossed.

 

It appeared to be a small bone with tiny horns coming out of the red bulb on top. The red bulb rested on a patch of brownish fur. He shrugged and made a motion to throw it away.

 

The bulb suddenly parted in half to reveal an eye.

 

“YOU IDIOT!” WX shouted before he seemed to be able to stop himself. At the same time, Wilson threw it as hard as he could. All three of us held our breath, paralyzed in fear of what Wilson may or may not have summoned.

 

We're gonna die, aren't we?

 

We quickly glanced to the side as footsteps crunched in the snow. We were the first to hear it due to our superior hearing, but soon they turned too.

 

Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.

 

The creature made itself shown.

 

Our first reaction was fear, but it was quickly shoved down. It bounced above the snow, its orange skin standing out against the snow just as bad as our fur did. Two white horns protruded out of its head, and four, sturdy, red legs were keeping its body just below the snow's top.

 

There was a moment of awkward silence as we tried to figure out if we had to be scared of this creature or not. It was still as well, a pink tongue rolling out of its mouth as it panted like a dog. It licked its chops, looking around (although it could barely be considered that due to its apparent lack of eyes) before stopping, facing the bone. It bounced over to it and picked it up in its mouth, before bounding to Wilson's feet and dropping it.

 

“Is it... hostile?”

 

Wilson seemed lost for words as he picked up the eye bone. “I... I think it's a friend...”

 

“Have you seen it in your book?”

 

“I... have no idea...”

 

More silence.

 

“Can.... can we keep it? We've always wanted a dog.”

 

“NO!”

 

“I... don't see why not if it's not hostile...”

 

“ARE YOU BOTH IDIOTS?”
 

“Probably,” I snickered, bending over the creature and patting its head. It panted with joy and licked our hand.

 

“Don't worry,” Wilson scoffed. “I'll make sure he's not some sort of vicious creature. Just in case, though, don't get too attached to him, Webber.”

 

“We won't!” I lied as the creature tackled us in into the snow. A spark of warmth lit in our chest. It's been a long time since we've been able to laugh like this.

 

We sighed happily, hugging the creature we just met.

 

It's been a long time... It was a beautiful day to Kyra. The trees were completely stripped of their leaves, letting the winter sky show through the branches clearly. Snow lay in drifts or blankets all across the clearing. She smelled food nearby, but her belly was full from the morning hunt and the entire pack was in a state of relaxed harmony. The ice hound rested her powerful jaw against the ground, her tail waving gently back and forth as she kept a watchful eye on her pup.

 

The pup- who was currently unnamed due to being too young to receive a name- was playing with two slightly older pups, Sizzle and Ebony. He showed no resentment to the older hounds for having names while he didn't yet. Even though they were older, he was bigger. Kyra couldn't help but see the compact muscles forming under his thick blue fur and the broadness of his shoulders as he shoved Sizzle off of him and growled playfully at her. Besides Kyra, her friend and the mother of Sizzle and Ebony was cleaning her paw. Rose paused long enough to watch the three pups at play for a few seconds before returning to cleaning her fiery red paw.

 

“He's going to be a strong hunter,” Rose praised, motioning towards Kyra's pup with her nose. “He's already bigger than my litter. He'll probably be bigger than you before he's fully grown.”

 

"He'll be just like his father," Kyra murmured, stretching before settling into a sitting position. She was leaner than the pup, built for speed like many female hounds instead of strength like males. Still, though. Females tended to be a bit bigger, and the fact that Rose's prediction about her pup being bigger than her when he grew up was probably true was a bit startling to her at first.

 

Rose gently lowered her paw, frowning at Kyra with concern in her eyes. “Do you still think about him?” She asked softly.

 

“Of course.” Ebony reared up against Sizzle, swinging her paws at her sister in hopes to get her nose. In retaliation, Kyra's pup butted Ebony in the flank and pinned her to the ground. Ebony struggled for a moment to get him off before Sizzle crashed into him and they all collapsed into a furry pile of hound- Sizzle a fire hound, Ebony a non-elemental, and her pup an ice hound. “I think about him all the time... my pup will bear his name when he gets older.”

 

“Shatter?” Rose looked thoughtfully at the unnamed pup before nodding. “It'll suit him fine...” She looked at Kyra for a moment, her eyes wide with pity, before licking her ear.

 

“I... I just don't want to lose him too.” Kyra looked at her paws. “Do you suppose he remembers his sister?”
 

“I doubt it,” Rose said heavily. “He was less than a day old when...” her voice faded off. “Kyra, it'll be alright. He'll be a powerful hunter and fighter. If he gets strong enough, he might even be able to take on Varg!”

 

The two she-hounds turned their attention to the leader of the pack, the mighty, brown-furred brute they called Varg, who had stopped near the pups to watch their game. Kyra felt sick to her stomach at the mere thought of her tiny puppy, the last connection she had with Shatter, taking on Varg. Shatter was a third Varg's size... even if my pup gets as big as his father he'll be no match for him...

 

“Oh Kyra,” Rose sighed. “I was exaggerating. I don't think he has an ambitious bone in his body. Even if he did end up challenging Varg, Varg wouldn't hurt him enough to kill him.”

 

“I just... I don't want to lose him like I lost his father.”

 

“Shatter died bravely,” Kyra's friend said sternly.

 

Suddenly, Varg raised his huge head, his ears twisting to face forward. A duo of female ice hounds, the best scouts for this weather, leaped out from the undergrowth, their fur bristling. Even if you didn't know them, it was obvious they were littermates. They had identically pointed ears and rounded eyes, although one was smaller than the other- the runt of that litter. “Varg!” The larger one, Crystal, panted. “Important news!”
 

The brown beast abandoned the pups, who had broken apart from their tussle to watch the exchange with wide, curious eyes, and slowly padded towards the sisters. Kyra's pup almost instinctively bounded over to his mother. He reared onto his haunches and pawed at Kyra's belly. She licked him on the head and lowered herself onto her side. The pup squeaked with happiness and he pummeled her belly with his wide, strong paws.

 

Varg was now standing over the two scout-hounds, his breaths appearing as clouds of steam in the frosty air. “You smell like salt,” he growled. The smaller sister, Frostbite, cowered slightly, but Crystal met his gaze boldly.

 

“We saw the Deerclops,” she explained. “And we followed it to make sure it stayed out of our territory.

 

“It was chasing the survivors!” Frostbite exclaimed, her voice high-pitched with fear. “It drove them off a cliff!”

 

“Sir, it is safe to assume that the survivors are no longer the survivors.” Crystal looked amused about the situation.

 

“There. That's one of your problems solved,” Rose commented to Kyra. “That's what they needed and deserved for killing part of our pack.” Rose fell silent for a moment, and Kyra remembered that her mate was also killed- but he was stabbed by one of the previous groups of survivors. “You don't have to worry about Varg sending mini-Shatter out on the battlefield against them.”

 

Even though there was a teasing note in the fire hound's voice, Kyra was visibly relieved. Varg stopped trying to appear intimidating. “Are you sure they're dead?” Varg grumbled.

 

"They took a plunge off of a thirty hound-length cliff into the water only an ice hound can survive. There's no way they could have survived it," Crystal promised with absolute certainty.

 

Varg nodded and turned. “Kyra!” He barked, so loudly the she-hound jumped.

 

“Uh-oh,” Rose murmured.

 

Now he made his way to stand over Kyra and her pup, examining the latter with sharp eyes. “Kyra, how old is your pup now?”

 

"Two months," Kyra responded, frowning. She knew very well that a nursing hound was nearly third-in-command in the pack, and that he wouldn't dare to lay a claw on her.

 

“How long until he's old enough to be weaned?” Varg pressed.

 

“Another month.” Kyra frowned. He wants me back on hunting. He wants to get my pup to start hunting. She flinched as she imagined the tiny pup against an entire beefalo herd. She gingerly licked him again on the head, and he looked up at her with big, trusting puppy eyes. She wrapped her entire body around him as Varg walked away, dragging his heavy paws. He won't have to do that if I have any say.

 

Nothing will ever happen to my pup.

 

No one will ever touch him.

 

She rested her muzzle on his furry forehead.

 

No one. There was ice beginning to form on the tip of my spear and in between my fingers. The hot, dry smell of the desert conflicted terribly with the icy temperature everywhere else, disallowing for any definite strategy for keeping a comfortable warmth. I snorted with impatience. Any time, now!

 

A loud rustling from the undergrowth somewhere near me alerted me that someone else had gotten tired of waiting as well. Webber broke out into the desert, claws gleaming and teeth bared as he lunged for the blue creature who, up until now, had been peacefully munching away. It let out a startled bleat, hopping away. Webber drew back, growling just loud enough for my sensors to pick up. He looked back, caught my eye, and nodded once. I nodded back. Arguments and petty rivalries could be set aside for survival, surely. Keeping low to the ground, he made a wide circle, disappearing to my vision. The goat looked up again, looking in fear of Webber's direction, before bleating again, louder this time, and fleeing straight towards me.

 

As soon as it was within range, I broke from my own cover and swung my weapon in a wide arc, cracking the beast against the side of its head. It pitched sideways, obviously dazed, and I raised my weapon again, preparing to stab it in its neck. Before I could bring it down, something shoved me aside roughly, and when I looked up again, Webber was on top of the creature, his knife buried deep in its throat. It started thrashing, but he held on, and eventually, its struggle subsided. Only then did he release it and back away, looking pleased with himself. Annoyance welled up in my chest. “WHAT WAS THAT FOR? THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY KILL.”

 

He smiled in a way that was just asking to be punched. “You weren't quick enough,” he replied calmly. “And it wouldn't stay dazed for long.” He wiped his claws off on his fur before meeting my gaze again defiantly. With a glimmer in his eye, he added, “In a few years, you might be able to be half as fast with a kill as we are.” I tried to think of something to say in response, but he cut me off before I could. “Brr! It's too cold to just be standing around arguing! Let's get this back to camp, shall we? Wilson will think we've frozen to death.”

 

“YOU SAY AS THOUGH IT WOULD BE A BAD THING,” I grumbled, but had to grudgingly admit he had a point. I pushed past him before he could even attempt to grab the slain animal and grabbed it by one of its twisted horns. Despite the chill, it felt slightly warm beneath my grasp. I gave him a glare, expecting him to protest, but he had already turned away and was walking calmly back to camp. Annoyed, I followed him. Imagine having to follow the lead of a scrawny half-bred fleshling! My mind scoffed. Oh, how far I've fallen.

 

About halfway through the forest, I dared to look up and squint through the trees. The sky was beginning to turn darker, and with it, even harsher frosts. Webber dropped behind to match my pace, tracing my gaze to the sky.

 

“It won't be long until spring,” he commented distractedly. “The air tastes less like ice, more like melted water.” He sniffed. “Smells too much like wet dog, if you ask us.”

 

“I WAS NOT PLANNING TO.”

 

He pointed at the sun, ignoring me. “The days have been getting longer. I don't think you'll like spring very much. It's very rainy. Summer will be even worse." He shivered. "The sun will be so hot, the trees won't help to protect us from the heat very much. And the days will be so long, and the nights so short, we won't even be able to rely on using the coolness of nighttime to do anything."

 

I glanced sharply at him. “YOU KNOW THIS HOW?”

 

“We've still been having dreams, you know,” he went on. “We think Wilson has been too. Nightmares are getting to both of us.” He finally looked at me, frowning slightly. “But we can never remember them when we wake up. What about you? Any strange dreams lately?”

 

“IF I DID, I WOULD NOT TELL YOU,” I snapped.

 

“Yes. Weird...” He shook his head.

 

Something caught my eye before I could reply. I turned to look at it, but it was gone. “TAKE THE CREATURE BACK TO THE CAMP AND MAKE SURE POOR WILSON DOES NOT GET SCARED. I WANT TO CHECK SOMETHING.”

 

“Also known as you're tired of being in our presence.” Webber snickered. “Alright, we get it, you're too amazing and superior. Have fun freezing to death out there while we're nice and cozy and warm by the fire.” There was a teasing note in his voice as he grabbed the goat from my grasp, but I remained silent and refused to reply. I hadn't been able to get a good look at it, but it felt important somehow. I waited until he disappeared from sight before changing course and heading towards where I saw the glint of blue light.

 

The snowbirds flew into the sky with a loud flutter of wings as they officially recognized the coming of dusk. A few braver birds tentatively flew down again to peck at the seeds still littering the ground, but otherwise, it turned almost entirely silent. I won't be long.

 

I listened intently to the area around me- I wasn't going to be caught off guard, not again. There was no way I was going to let another... fleshbag... rescue me again. It was humiliating the first time. It wouldn't happen again.

 

Eventually, the forest broke open into an almost unnaturally round clearing. The first stars were beginning to appear in the darker part of the horizon. In the center of the clearing, a ring of green mushrooms had sprouted, reaching for the sky's last remaining light, but that was far from the most interesting thing I saw.

 

The middle of the mushrooms harbored a smooth, white-streaked gray rock, just high enough to reach my knees I assumed, despite it being just too far away to tell exactly, and perched on said rock was a person. A real person, not a skeleton, not some weird and random creature, facing away from me. I found myself pausing, trying to figure out what to feel. Should I feel excited to see another living person here? Should I attack him- he could be a threat. But instead, I did the one thing I didn't want to do.

 

I did nothing.

 

I just sort of watched him.

 

He wore a brown leather tunic and a tan undershirt, even though surely the clothing wasn't thick or covering enough to protect him from the temperature or anything else for that matter. He had a mess of short brown hair on his head, and by far, the most interesting part about him was the sword. It hung at his side, glowing brightly and shedding blue light on the frost-covered ground and the figure himself, sharp and pristine.

He stiffened, and then he turned to face me.

 

His eyes.

 

They were glowing.

 

All of the instances of glowing eyes in the past hit me hard, but his weren't amber. They were blue- the same blue as his blade. I quickly looked for something to say, but before I could, the air seemed to shift and suddenly, the clearing, the mushroom ring, and the man were all gone. I was left alone, deep in the heart of the forest, with nothing but traces of sunlight to guide me. I stumbled backward, nearly tripping over myself, before turning and running as fast as I could home. I could not make sense of what I had seen, but there was a sense of dread deep in my chest.

 

Something told me that this vision, tonight, was the hint of something terrible to come.

 

And we would all be helpless to stop it. “He'll never be able to do it! What are you going to do about it, huh Wildumb?”

 

“That's not even a creative insult!”

 

A splash of cold snow, instantly numbing any skin it got into contact to.

 

“Fight back, you weakling!”

 

“How? With his tiny little chicken arms?”

 

Laughter.

 

A chilly wind ran through my hair, jostling me from the deepness of my thoughts. The sun had not yet to rise, but something felt different. Something about.. the air. Uncertainly, with a hint of fear and concern, I found myself looking at my immediate area, trying to figure out exactly where it was coming from. “Do you feel that, WX?” I called to the robot, half-aware as always during this time of day. He snapped from his own thoughts and turned his eyeless gaze to me.

 

“FEEL WHAT?”

 

“That crackling tension in the air...”

 

There was a pause, machinery humming softly against the silent black night before replying. “IT IS ELECTRICAL,” he said thoughtfully. “AND YET, NATURAL AT THE SAME TIME. PERHAPS LIGHTNING, OR A STORM.”

 

Thundersnow? That might be an interesting sight, although I'm not particularly fond encountering it now.

 

“I HOPE IT IS NOT,” he ended, nestling a bit more into the bark of the tree he leaned against. “BUT THE KID SPOKE OF SPRING'S ARRIVAL. MAYBE HE'S ACTUALLY CORRECT ABOUT SOMETHING FOR ONCE IN HIS LIFE.”

 

His gaze shifted slightly to the kid in question, bundled into one of the weirdest sleeping positions I had ever seen. He looked more like a heap of black fur than a person.

 

“It's been winter for what feels like way too long. I hope spring is soon.”

 

The robot said nothing, probably thinking about rain by the expression on his face.

 

The sky was beginning to turn paler, milky fingers of light stretching across the nearly black expanse. I stood, stretching, and brushed myself off. “I guess it doesn't matter. As long as we're able to get to that Goose before Spring's end.”

 

“YOU SPEAK OF KILLING THE GIANTS, YET YOU DARED NOT TO HUNT THE DEERCLOPS?” WX pointed out, standing as well.

 

“That was... different.” I grimaced. The last thing I wanted, to be honest, was to fight the Deerclops. It was infinitely more terrifying than the Bearger and, according to the book, much more powerful. Fighting the Goose first for her precious down feathers would probably be the smartest course of action.

 

I chose to ignore that after Spring and the Goose was Summer and the Dragonfly. I preferred not to think about fighting the Dragonfly.

 

Finally, a ray of light hit me in the face, bringing with it a wind that was far from bitter. I looked around, eyeing the trees around me and watching in wonder as the snow clinging to their branches all Winter began to drip off of their needles. I nearly exclaimed in excitement, but I was abruptly cut off by a rather ungraceful sound of annoyance as a cascade of droplets showered WX, sneaking into his frame and causing sparks to explode from him. He looked frustrated already.

 

Not to help matters any, the water also woke up someone that would make him even more frustrated.

 

He stretched and yawned, blinking up at the sky with a loud sniff. “Oi, smells like Spring. Is it Spring?” Webber glanced at WX, a sly smirk coming to his face. “You probably deserve that.”

 

He was returned with an intense glare, as though the robot was daring him to continue.

 

“You know, I'm rather hungry,” I intervened before they could start yet another fight. “Maybe we can go to the rabbit holes and get something to eat. Would you be alright with cleaning the animals if we hunt them, Webber?”

 

The spider boy shrugged as he stood, stretching once more. “Of course. Would hate to see one of you puke because we refuse to.”

 

I beckoned for WX to follow me, in hopes that it would distract him from the argument. It partially did, given that he still shot a few glares behind him, but credit where credit is due, he followed without verbal protest.

 

The sun had fully risen by the time we reached the savanna. The air was lighter and fresher than I ever remembered seeing it, and the distant birch forest disappeared into a sea of green. WX scanned the area before huffing. “THEY HAVE HIDDEN AWAY FOR BREEDING SEASON,” he said with a scowl, pacing to the nearest collapsed set and peering inside of it. He kicked the mound of earth at the entrance and turned to face me. “WHAT BRIGHT IDEA DO YOU HAVE NOW, SCIENTIST?”

 

“I'm thinking, I'm thinking.” I waved him away. It would really suck not being able to stock up on rabbit meat before Summer arrived, but it could prove useful as a catalyst to exploring new food sources... “Perhaps we could try the desert again?” I suggested, but he was already shaking his head.

 

“LET THE GOATS REPRODUCE. THE LAST THING WE WOULD WANT IS TO DESTROY THEIR HERD COMPLETELY.”

 

“Well, what bright ideas do you have?”

 

He pointed to the birch forest on the other side of the savanna with his spear. “NUTS, BERRIES, PIGS. ALL WOULD MAKE A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FOOD.”

 

“Pigs?” I grimaced at the thought of eating a pig. Surely they would have touch and stringy meat, and the thought of eating something that was able to produce cognitive thought patterns enough to at least speak in broken English...

 

“ARE YOU AFRAID TO FIGHT THEM?”

 

“I'm afraid to eat them. It feels... wrong to.”

 

He scoffed. “THEY ARE JUST ANIMALS, WILSON. DESIGNED TO BE SLAUGHTERED AND EATEN.”

 

“Well, I'm not going to. I don't care what you eat but I'll stick to things that don't talk to me, thank you.”

 

He made a face eerily similar to one rolling their eyes. “FINE. I SUPPOSE WE CAN KILL A COUPLE OF BUZZARDS AT LEAST SO WE HAVE SOMETHING WITH SUSTENANCE.” He hoisted his spear over his shoulder. Most of the walk to the desert was in silence, except for a low grumbling noise slowly growing louder and closer.

 

And the rain started to pour.

 

WX tried so hard not to react to it, that it was almost comical. His facial expressions voiced his unspoken frustration and anger as sparks flew from him. The suffocating heat of the desert washed over us as we broke out into the wide, sandy expanse. Almost instantly, he held out his arm as a signal to stop, and pointed ahead with his other hand. “THE VOLT GOATS ARE ENRAGED.”

 

“What? Are you kidding me?” I pushed slightly past him and looked towards the herd myself. Several of them looked rabid- their blue fur was spiked up erratically and their eyes glowed with hatred. Lastly, their mouths were contorted into snarls as they apparently confronted some unknown enemy.

 

I took an alarmed step backward.

 

“I BLAME THE KID,” he decided aloud.

 

I snorted with amusement and glanced at him in the corner of my eye. “Why?” I laughed.

 

He shrugged. “NEED TO BLAME SOMEONE. ALRIGHT. THROW DOWN THE BAIT AND LET'S DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE. UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU DO NOT WANT TO, AND YOU WOULD PREFER TO STAND HERE UNTIL YOU BECOME PART OF THE DESERT. EITHER IS FINE WITH ME.”

 

I elbowed him. “Shut up you love us.” I dug through my bag and tossed a stale morsel that most likely belonged to a rabbit at one point onto the ground and waited for the vultures to take the bait.

 

…

 

We got home just as the sun was setting. We both dragged two limp corpses behind us, the birds' muddy feathers making small furrows in the ground as we walked. It was still raining, except now it was accompanied by periodic flashes of lightning.

 

WX's steps were beginning to falter, as though the rain was beginning to get to him.

 

“Are you okay?” I asked as I paused for him to catch up for the fourth time.

 

“I AM FINE. JUST NEED TO GET DRY,” his words sounded a bit slurred as well. I frowned in concern, but he waved it away. “I WILL BE OKAY WHEN IT STOPS RAINING.”

 

“Alright... just maki-” My words were cut off as a particularly loud lighting flash sent me tumbling to my feet, muddying my clothes and ripping the flesh of the birds I held. It looked like lightning had struck right next to me...

 

Slightly in panic, I looked up to make sure WX was alright, but he seemed unharmed. In fact, he was standing much taller than he was previously, examining his hands curiously as tiny bolts of lightning jumped across his frame. He was glowing.

 

“Are you alright!?”

 

“SYSTEM OVERLOAD...” he replied softly. “I NEVER EXPECTED THIS TO HAVE MADE IT INTO MY DESIGN.” He clenched and released his fists, as though testing them out. “I AM MORE THAN ALRIGHT.” He took a shaky step forward, as though trying to get his bearings again.

 

“Were you struck??”

 

“IT APPEARS SO.”

 

I shakily got to my feet and rested my hand on his shoulder. I could feel his entire body buzzing. “How does it feel?”

 

“INVIGORATING,” he said simply. “LIKE I COULD OUTRUN DEATH.”

 

I took a step back again, nodding. “That may come in useful.” And as if to echo my words, in the far distance, echoing through the pines, I heard the faintest noise- a loud and angry honk. I looked in the direction of it, glaring into the woods. Who knows if any of us have any other undiscovered powers or abilities. We're only getting stronger by the day.

 

Come at us, Goose. We're ready for you. “Watch me, pup, I will show you how we hunt.” Kyra stretched luxuriously, showing off her rippling muscles as she watched her little pup hop up to her. He was growing muscular, just like his father, and she felt a hint of pride. She nodded to a fallen tree trunk that lay on the forest floor just ahead, resting slightly above the ground on a rock. His eyes followed her gaze and he tipped his head.

 

“Are we gonna hunt a tree, Mommy?” He bared his tiny teeth- clean and sharp. “Imma show my teeth and scare it into submission. Graa!” He lunged at it, but she gently reached forward and nipped his scruff before he could.

 

“Now, be patient, pup,” she purred. “Hunting is not all about scaring your prey. You must be quick and painless in killing them.”

 

“Why though, Mommy?” He worked his paws in the earth. “The food isn't hounds. Why do we have to be nice to it?”

 

“Because all living creatures are like us, little one. We just want to survive. Now, pay attention to me.” Kyra narrowed her eyes, envisioning the tree trunk as the dusty pale coat of a beefalo, before charging at full speed. Her bulk tore away at fronds and brambles until she reached it. Instead of launching herself at it, she feinted to the side and slipped under the trunk, pressing her spine against it and freeing it from its perch. It fell with a thump, and before it had time to settled she was on top of it, her teeth ripping away at bark where the beast's neck would be. Finally, she released it, panting with elation as she dipped her head to her little pup. “Now, what did you see me do?”
 

But he wasn't watching anymore. His huge eyes were traced on a butterfly, fluttering around his nose before landing on it. He sneezed, and looked back at Kyra innocently. Despite herself, she wasn't able to be mad at him. She padded towards him and nuzzled his neck fur. Oh, Shatter, I can't send him out to battle. Varg wants him ready by mid-Spring and... I don't think I have it in my heart to.

 

She licked his cheek, and turned back to their encampment. “Come on, little one, let's get you something to eat.” Like all hounds in the pack currently, her pup had the slightest hint of fat in his cheeks and flanks, but that was alright. They could hunt as much as they liked until Summer, in which the fire hounds would take over as it became too hot for any other hound to bear. She wasn't worried, though. Her friend, Rose, would likely make sure there was enough for all of the pups to have their share.

 

“Mommy?” Her puppy spoke up behind her, and she slowed down to let him catch up.

 

“Yes, little one?”

 

He paused, clawing at the ground before continuing. “What happened to my Daddy?” He asked finally, looking genuinely curious.

 

Instantly, she felt the pang of grief fresh in her chest. “What do you know about your father?” She asked gently.

 

“I know he was a big and strong hound!” He said happily. “And he was sweet and loved by everyone. But... what happened to him?” Fire lit in his eyes, something that surprised Kyra and scared her even a little bit. “Did the mean Survivors get him! I'll kill all of them!”

 

Her steps faltered a little bit, almost terrified of her own puppy. The pack is corrupting his mind... she realized suddenly, but she shook her head to drive the treacherous thought away. The thought had been appearing a lot more recently, and she couldn't help but wonder if there was a better life for him. No. The pack brings safety, and food, and shade in the Summer. Nothing can be better than that. “It wasn't the Survivors,” she corrected him gently. “It was a beefalo.” She remembered the scene clearly now, running with the wind in their fur and joy in their steps. Shatter and Kyra running side-by-side, their fur brushing as their muscles stretched and folded to the same rhythm. She had loved her mate with all of her heart, and even though she spent countless nights wondering and thinking and crying, she could never figure out what went wrong- why that time was what brought the mighty hound down.

 

It was well before her pup was born, she didn't even know that she was carrying pups at the time, but even though there had been whispers spread about her mate disappearing just before she found out she was carrying pups, she knew that they were their's. And now, the rest of the pack couldn't deny it either. No other hound had such a bulky and powerful build. She lowered her head, breathing in the chilly sent of her precious son. She loved him. She loved him with all of her heart. The pack would expect the same of him that they came to expect of Shatter. He's too tiny... he's so small... please, don't make him attack entire herds of beefalo, please don't think he can do as much as his father could. Please... I can't lose another pup.

 

“Don't we eat the beefalo, though, Mommy?” His sweet, innocent voice brought her back from her thoughts. “How did the beefalo-”

 

“I don't know,” she cut him off, just wanting to not be reminded again of how her mate fell. “But, what I do know,” she continued before he could be deflated by her dismissive tone. “Is that there's something very special I must discuss with Varg when we get back.”

 

…

 

“Shatter, hmm?” Varg mused, lifting his mighty head from the pool of which he drank. “A powerful name for a powerful pup, Kyra. But it would bear a weight that he might not be able to handle- do you really think he will grow up to be as strong as his father?” His beady eyes met Kyra's, thoughtfully. “Do you think it would discourage him, knowing he might not be able to fill the footsteps his name would set out for him?”

 

She lifted her chin slightly. “I am very sure, my Alpha.”

 

Varg shook his head slightly. “If you are certain, then the ceremony shall take place immediately. It's about time he's gotten a proper name.” He shook himself off before raising his head. “It is time for a pack meeting!” He barked, his voice low and smooth. Kyra stood by his side proudly, but then felt that pang of pain return. Shatter should have been on his other side. “There is a pup who has grown into his name. Pup of Kyra and Shatter, stand forward.” She saw the confusion across the face of her puppy as he stumbled out of the den after Sizzle and Ebony. He yawned, then scampered to stand at Varg's feet. Varg nodded to Kyra. “Go on.”

 

She took a step forward. “Before Shatter and I came to this pack, all we knew was hunting and an owner who cared nothing for us. We were nothing but a tool for his survival, and we got only the scraps of what we hunted. But neither of us could have expected to find such amount of love in this pack and more importantly, in each other. Shatter, if you can hear me now, I want you to know that I still love you, and I wish you were here to stand beside us now.” She dipped her head. “But I have thought long and hard on this, and I realize that you are not fully gone, but you live on in our son. Which is why I request our leader to pass on your name to our pup.”

 

“Kyra's request is a humble one,” Varg rumbled. “And I accept. From this moment on, this nameless pup shall no longer be nameless. In its place, I pass you the name of Shatter, so that your father's legacy shall not go unremembered.”

 

She could see the shock and excitement flashing over the newly named Shatter's face, as though he couldn't believe that he had a name now. He didn't move or speak, but finally, he broke away and buried his face in Kyra's chest, laughing and crying at the same time. She touched her nose to his head. “You earned it, little one.” The sky was clear for the first time in days, thankfully enough. The constant rain was, in all honesty, driving us insane. The rain brought one good thing though- perfect opportunities to mess with WX as he was rendered practically useless by it unless he was struck by lightning, an occurrence that had happened only once that we knew of, that being when he and Wilson had gone out hunting.

We were all together now, trekking through the slightly less familiar forests outside of our typical pathways and places of interest. We lagged behind the other two, our whiskers twitching with concentration as we listened and scented for any change in the air. We were learning the ins and outs of this new world, no longer were any of us left completely victim to its twists and turns. A new, fresher breeze brought a new scent to our nose, and we paused, growling softly to tell the others to do the same. It was faintly similar to the smell of vultures or crows, but with a musky tang we couldn't recognize. Wilson saw our confused look and looked around. "What's wrong?"

“Dunno... we smell something we're not familiar with.” A thought came to us. “Maybe it's the Goose? Should we follow it?”

“What do you two think?”

WX shrugged. “THAT IS OUR FINAL GOAL, IS IT NOT?”

“We're ready for a fight.” We rolled our shoulders. This would be our first step to killing the giants. This is what we had been preparing for since the fateful encounter telling us what we had to do. “We've been ready for a fight.” No more sitting and watching and waiting.

"Alright, lead the way then." Wilson nodded to us, and we obliged, taking the head and following the scent of the Goose. There was the sensation of tingling in the air that grew more intense as the scent grew stronger, like lightning arriving on the horizon.

The cover of the forest broke out into the frog-infested grassland, but almost the entire valley was haunted by the shadow of a larger being.

We could see her, standing on the crest of the hill. The sun was behind her at this point, making her form nothing but a mere silhouette. Wilson brought in a sharp gasp of air and WX took a step back. She was bigger than we could've imagined.

“Alright, here's the plan.” Wilson seemed to snap out of his stupor and lowered his voice. “There's three of us and one of her. She has strength and size over us, but we have numbers and speed. We need to disorient her, make sure she can't hit any of us.” He nodded at WX. “You're the heaviest hitter of any of us, and you can take the most hits. Think you can try to bring her down? If you focus enough on her legs she'll have to fall, and then we can get to her neck and head.” The robot nodded, focusing on the titanic shape on the hill. “Webber, you're the fastest. Try to keep her attention away from WX, and try to hit and dodge as much as you can. WX might be able to tank her, but you're fast enough to kite her. Got it?”

“Sounds easy enough.” We cracked our knuckles. Our blood was boiling like it hadn't for years- the readiness for battle that we had not felt since forcing ourself to act more civilized.

It felt... good. Addicting, almost. Our senses felt heightened, and we could almost smell the warm salt of the blood running through the massive creature's body. It took us a long moment to realize we were panting, and our face had been twisted into a snarl. It took us a moment even longer to realize that Wilson was giving us a concerned look, but we waved him off before he could say anything. He didn't need to know about this craving for battle, one of the few primitives things left from our other half. Wilson looked unconvinced, but he apparently chose not to protest. Instead, he merely motioned for WX and me to flank the monster. Slightly grateful, but refusing to admit it, we dropped onto a quadrupedal stance to approach it near-silently.

The Goose was milling around peacefully, hopping around in useless circles as if patrolling- or maybe, she's just too stupid to have any idea of what she's doing. Her bulk made the very earth shake, and we could see glimpses of reflected metal as WX was understandably tossed slightly out of his shelter, probably tripping from the vibrations. We, however, were unaffected, easily keeping steady even as the world shook around us.

Her head turned to the side.

She had seen something.

Her body turned as if she were looking at something behind her, and, as if we shared the same mind, we both slunk out of our cover. We could see the egg now, huge and gray with lightning sparking from it.

She honked in surprise as we reached her first, brandishing our weapon. We leaped and channeled all of our power into thrusting it into her leg. The smooth black skin split and her honk turned to rage. She kicked us away, the spear still embedded firmly in her skin, then raised her injured leg to stomp us into the ground.

WX got there first. His own spear held firmly in his grip, he was at our side in an instant, pressing the flat end of the spear into the ground with the sharp end sticking up. The inertia of her stomp was too great for her to stop in time, before impaling her own foot on the weapon. WX let out a grunt of satisfaction as she reared back. Both spears fell to the ground, and the blood flow from both had already been staunched.

She paused for a moment as if unsure as to which of her pesky targets to hit first. Her gaze landed on us, perhaps realizing that we were smaller and therefore had less defense against an attack. Satisfaction filled our chest as we figured that she probably suspected that we were just any child or easily smashable spider. The Goose let out what we assumed to be a battle cry, her wings flashing out as pure and primal rage twisted her beak into a snarl. She dipped her long neck down and bucked with her horns. For the most part, she missed, but the air from the force of the attack still swept us off of our feet. Her muscles rippled under the feathers of her body as she tried yet again to crush us into the ground.

We saved ourself this time, rolling out of the way of her attack while grabbing our weapon as we did so. WX had his weapon now, as well. He looked frustrated, but he attacked again nonetheless. His spear buried into the flesh just above her foot, deep enough that the sharpened end protruded from the opposite side of her leg. She didn't seem to notice, her gaze transfixed on us.

She reared back again, but this time her battle cry was caught off by someone else's.

"Go for the eyes!" Wilson shouted, his gray eyes alight with a fire we had never seen from the docile scientist before. In his grasp was not a spear, but instead, a weapon we were hardly familiar with- a glowing blue morning star. He heaved the weapon up, looking slightly strained, and swung at the same place that WX's spear was still embedded in. There was true anger in her honk now. We won't be able to do anything to her as long as we're only able to reach her legs. Luckily for them, we know what we're doing. Her attention temporarily focused on Wilson and WX, we disappeared into one of the many trees surrounding the Goose's nest. We scooted up the tree like a squirrel and stuck our head out of the newly growing leaves. The scent of springtime growth was almost enough to override the overpowering smell of bird meat, so powerful it was nearly dizzying.

Shaking our head vigorously, we reached the top of the tree and looked out. She had not seemed to notice our absence, too busy with focusing on Wilson and WX to care that we had disappeared. She wasn't very close, but it was close enough. Bunching our muscles, and taking a deep breath, we unsheathed our claws and lunged at her.

Her eyes caught ours in mid-air. A single, high-pitched noise erupted from her throat.

We were unable to dodge as she flicked her head to the side and knocked us out of the air, her horns hit our rib cage hard enough that we could almost swear that we heard something crack. For a split moment, we were almost certain that we were going to black out. It was terrifying, being flung through the air like a ragdoll.

Perhaps this was the reason we managed to stay conscious. Awareness spread through our limbs suddenly, and we managed to roll in mid-air to land neatly on all fours again. We were still intact.

But the failed attempt at a better fighting angle hadn't done anything to relax our mood. Letting out a snarl that rumbled deep in our chest and throat, we grabbed our weapon once more and rejoined the fight.

“Let me fight.”

No. You won't be careful enough to avoid collateral damage.

“I've always been a better fighter than you.”

I don't trust you. Stop distracting me. We shook our head furiously, trying to clear the webs from our thoughts. We were moving again before we even realized it, throwing up clots of dirt as our claws dug into the ground, with our spear being held in our mouth. We pushed past WX, who was viciously stabbing whatever he could reach of her, anger and determination burning in his eyeless gaze, and took a flying leap. Our claws pricked into the Goose's skin, allowing us to climb up her body almost as easily as we had climbed the tree.

She shook her whole body, probably trying to shake us off, but we clung to her feathers like a burr.

"Webber! Are you stupid?!" Wilson shouted from the ground. We, naturally, completely ignored him. We shifted our spear to our hand, clinging on with all other limbs, and stabbed the sharpened end into her neck. Warm blood bathed our claws, the smell of salt and sweetness overwhelming all other senses. It awakened a primal instinct in our mind, the pure feeling of power and approaching death sending us just inches away from falling into a pit of never-ending rage and bloodlust.

The beast gave a massive shudder, abruptly halting our descent into the blood-driven insanity. She contorted her neck almost unnaturally and threw us off with her beak. Too dazed by our outburst to do anything else, we hit the ground heavily on our side. All of the air in our lungs was lost, but we were pretty sure we weren't hurt that badly. The ground heaved again as the Goose collapsed, blood pumping from her neck wound.

We took a startled step back, blinking several times to clear it. Where did that feeling come from? And there was the Goose, still bleeding into the dirt... our claws shook slightly. Had we done that?

WX, however, didn't seem to be affected by it at all. The second the monster hit the ground, he was moving, his spear poised to strike. There was a sharp sense of guilt, almost enough to force us to call him off, but even if we were to do so, by the time we decided it, he was already sinking the sharp end into her long neck.

The sound erupting from the beast tore heartstrings as if she was truly in pure agony, but WX's grim expression stayed firm as he twisted the weapon, before yanking it out of the wound. Her body quivered as if trying to recover, but that didn't mean that it would help. There was too much blood- one of us, either WX or I, had punctured the artery that ran through her neck. She let out another soft honk, her eyes- were they always brown, or had we just never paid attention before?- drifting to the nest that she had fought so hard to protect. The egg had cracked at the top, but there was no way the moslings could survive without their mother for long.

We had won.

But it didn't feel like we did.

Had this enormous giant only been protecting its nest? Was there really no other reason for killing it, than for our own escape? What made our survival more important than this bird's?

Without a word, we inched closer to the Goose. Her breaths were short and shallow, but we knew there was no way she would get up again. This is wrong. She shouldn't be left to slowly die again. We raised our own weapon, our entire upper body shaking, and we thrust it into the spot right where her neck met her beak.

The beast sighed and disappeared into the ground. We didn't feel like puzzling over this fact, simply because there were other things on our mind. You're going soft, feeling pity for the things you're supposed to kill. What's next, crying over a rabbit? We got to one knee, closing our eyes and letting out a long sigh.

However, we were shaken back into the present world by the touch of a hand on our shoulder. We glanced up, meeting Wilson's worried gray gaze. “Are you okay? That was a pretty bad fall.”

“HE HAS SURVIVED WORSE,” WX mused, sounding to be the only of us that was not shaken. He simply bent down, touching one of the pools of blood and examining the red substance on his finger, before making his way closer to the egg. “HOW ARE WE TO GO ABOUT THIS?”

Wilson took a few steps forward as if planning to stand beside WX, but we stopped him, simply pointing at the widening cracks in the egg. "We're not done."

At first glance, the moslings looked kind of cute. The first one poked its head out of the very top, its entire body was covered in ruffled feathers, sticking out oddly like they had been rubbed furiously with a balloon. Their beaks were bluish in color, and their eyes were huge and innocent. The first one hopped out, making an odd caterwauling noise as if searching for its mother. It turned its head the other way to look at us from its other eye. In the corner of our eyes, we saw WX get once more into his battle stance, and Wilson's brow furrowed in concentration and worry. The mosling inched its way closer to us, still making that odd honking sound.

It must've taken a second to realize it, but it was finally beginning to realize that something was off- that something was missing.

And of course, it realized almost instantly that these strange intruders near its nest were the cause of this odd occurrence. It flung its wings out almost threateningly, its feathers bushing out until it appeared twice its size. The light of the now-setting sun caught on its yellow feathers, bathing them in a reddish color- like it's soaked in blood. Three more of its siblings tumbled out, and the egg shattered into pieces. Electricity fizzed in the air, so heavy that we could hear the static building in the world around us. Wilson's hair turned slightly more insane than usual, and we could feel our own fur bush out in response.

Then, without warning, without a cloud in the sky or a raindrop in the air, lightning cracked through the sky. WX turned his own gaze upwards, and we could see the faint glimmer of hunger glowing in his eyeless sockets, like a craving that needed satisfied. The wind whipped up around us, and all at once, as if on command, all four goslings lunged at us. Lightning struck again, hitting the ground just a couple feet away from us. We took a second to be glad that WX and Wilson would be too busy focusing on the fight to jest at our awkwardly standing fur. We were certain that we looked faintly similar to a deranged, lopsided catcoon. The first mosling landed on us- light and surprisingly soft to the touch despite the crackle of energy that fizzed between us, and its beak instantly clamped around our throat. We could feel the teeth lining the beak of the creature, hidden from sight, but harmful all the same.

Instincts kicked in the second we felt those teeth graze against the sensitive tendons in our throat, and we dropped into a roll. There were a muffled cracking noise and a squawk of protest. Snorting with satisfaction, our claws slid out and impaled the mosling's fragile body, earning a much louder screech of pain as they tore through its skin. Tearing the bird away from our throat we threw it to the ground. This time, the scent of blood and the feeling of ripping flesh startled us slightly, almost making us feel sick. We shook our head furiously, unable to drive the thoughts away, and pounced back onto the mosling we had thrown. Just as we were about to make a killing blow, something landed on our back. It wasn't heavy, but its talons were sharp enough to drive the breath from our lungs.

Lightning cracked again.

This time, however, it was accompanied by the mosling on our back being torn away with surprising strength. Still pinning our opponent into the ground, we looked up just in time to see the target of the lightning strike. WX wasted no time in stabbing the mosling from the head down, driving it straight into the ground beneath it, before raising his weapon and kicking it off. Whether or not it was dead yet, he raised one foot and stomped it into the ground with a sickening crack. The electricity that sparked in the air took a solid form on his frame, tiny bolts of lightning like static flashes jumped between his limbs as he raised his head once more, flipping his spear around and cracking the second mosling across the head.

Wilson didn't quite have his adversary under control. It was the biggest of the four, striking at him before dancing away in a mesmerizing pattern, like a ballad dancer getting all of its moves just right. Sweat beaded on his forehead as he swung out with his morning star, but the bird simply danced and dodged around the futile attacks to hit it. Growling deep in our throat, we wrapped our claws around the neck of the mosling, for just half a second feeling the fragility of the bones in its body, before snapping its neck with a quick flick of our wrist. We left this one to rot, barreling towards the beast that Wilson was fighting and hitting it from behind. Unlike the first we fought, this one was able to throw us off easily, but at least it threw off the careful and graceful movements it had been using to torment Wilson.

WX was at our side as well, reaching our aid in only two bounds, and ditching his spear in favor of brute strength. In almost perfect synchronization, Wilson swung his weapon in a wide arc, cracking the mosling in the side of the face; WX put all the power of his own strength plus the overcharge from the lightning strike behind a final blow, and our claws dug into creature's throat.

It didn't even have time to lash out. It was a quick, but certainly not bloodless, death.

We ripped our claws away, taking several stumbling steps back. We were panting again, shaking very slightly at the tips of our whiskers. Wilson and WX stepped away from the fallen mosling as well, the latter looking for all the world like he wanted to punch it again, just to be sure.

The sun had fallen by now, but the light of dusk was not totally gone just yet. Wilson walked numbly towards the destroyed nest, lifting up a sizable chunk of the egg that was about the size of our head. He turned back to us, seeming too out of breath to say anything, holding the eggshell out questioningly. His gaze swept over us, and he took an alarmed step back, fear flashing in his eyes before he shook it off.

He's afraid of us? How intriguing. I wonder why...

It wasn't until we turned away that we realized our claws were fully unsheathed, digging deeply into our palm, making blood drip... drip... drip... onto the ground beneath us. Scared would typically be the last thing I would describe my emotions, standing face-to-face with a seven-year-old that I had just fought a fifty-foot-tall Goose monster with.

In fact, I was pretty sure that had I thought about it before this whole mess started, I would've thought I was going insane. I wiped the sweat off of my forehead, partially formed from stress and partially from just overworking myself, and took a step back. I was shaking, I realized, probably from the fact that my friends and I had just taken on a fifty-foot-tall Goose monster and won. I had intensely mixed feelings of Oh my God did we just do that?! And We could've died and WE BEAT ONE OF THE GIANTS HOLY MOTHER OF SCIENCE. WX seemed to be satisfied with himself, crossing his arms with none of the energy or fear or guilt that I was sure Webber and I shared.

This battle did something to Webber. I couldn't tell exactly what it was, and I couldn't be sure of what it was I was seeing, but I knew one thing for sure.

There had been something else fighting with him. It wasn't something I had seen or something I heard, it was something that I just acknowledged and felt. It was something that was far beyond the forces of science to be able to comprehend. It wasn't good, it wasn't benign. There was something it wanted.

The first person to break the silence was the boy himself. He shook his entire body- not unlike a cat- and looked up to meet my eyes. “She wasn't evil,” he said at length. His voice was small and timid, more like the little boy he truly was instead of the fierce facade he managed. “Did you see the way she looked at her nest? She just wanted to protect her babies...”

He was echoing my own thoughts. I turned the shell over in my hands, feeling the unnaturally smooth surface brushing against the scrapes I had earned on my hands after using them to keep myself falling face-first into the dirt. Sure, to my little group, we had perfectly good reasons to be killing her, but did she realize this? I was gathering my thoughts to give him a reply, but WX was the first to jump into the conversation.

Apparently, a more WX-like fashion to replying to someone was to walk up behind him and backhand him heartily. “ANIMALS ARE STUPID,” he huffed. “IT PROBABLY DID NOT EVEN REALIZE IT WAS FIGHTING SOMETHING. THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY SORT OF THOUGHT PROCESS.”

“No, not it. Her.” I bent down, feeling the carefully created nest that the egg had been protected in. With her great size, how long had it taken her to construct this? It was so small... especially to be housing such a monstrous creature. “And, to be fair, WX, that way of thinking could be easily said both ways. Have you ever thought your own thoughts, or have you just always followed the thoughts programmed into you by a human?”

Did he turn his head, only slightly, to glance at Webber as I asked that?

“IN MY DEFENSE, I WAS HAND-CREATED BY THE MOST POWERFUL DIETY TO EXIST.” He tipped his head arrogantly. “YOU SHOULD FEEL BLESSED TO BE IN MY PRESENCE.”

I felt a smile try to force its way onto my lips, but the back of my mind still rambled about how the robot could possibly function. I felt my fingers twitch, wishing nothing more than to have a pencil and paper right now. Could WX feel anything other than what he was programmed to feel? Was there any way for me ever to figure this out?

I shook my head. Focus, Wilson! I turned away from WX and clapped a single time, pushing my worries about morality and personal ethics and everything in between to the back of my mind. I let the smile that came with knowing that we had just taken the first step to our freedom crack through. “Do you understand what this means? We're a fifth of the way done with this, guys!”

“I CANNOT WAIT TO BE DONE WITH DEALING WITH THE LIKES OF YOU.”

I was about ninety-nine percent sure that he was just saying stuff to act big and tough. However, I decided not to bring this up to him, in favor of keeping the bones in my lower jaw intact.

Webber gave the shard in our hand a dubious glance. "Are you sure that's good enough?" His 'whiskers' were twitching, but I couldn't tell if it was nervousness, amusement, or fear. His voice lowered. "Are you sure we don't have to do that again?" He sounded distant, his gaze glazing over and his claws curling again. A shiver ran down my spine. I had never seen him more spider than human, but that look in his eyes when he stabbed the Goose in the nest, the blood staining his black fur...

“IS OUR PLAN TO STAND HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND WAIT FOR THE NIGHT MONSTER TO CATCH US?” WX scoffed, holding out his arms, indicating the powerful glow coming from his body from the lightning that had struck him. I felt a pang of jealousy- when was I going to show up with awesome powers that rip someone's throat open or bash a mosling's head in with a single swing- but then I instantly felt fear spawning from these thoughts. Where had that come from? “I CAN ONLY STAY THIS WAY FOR SO LONG, YOU KNOW.”

"Right," I forced myself to say between my thoughts and worries. I had time to worry later when Webber was asleep and WX was in his nightly trance that he seemed to force himself into despite his inability to sleep. Now was the time for optimism. I hoisted the morning star over my shoulder, decidedly not nearly falling back due to the weight, and held the shell closely to my chest, trying not to crack it any further. "Safety first. Come on, Webber." I waited for him to break himself out of whatever state of half-consciousness he was in and follow me. He matched my steps, looking quite like he wanted to say something, but also looking too nervous to say whatever was on his mind. It was so weird.

As soon as I saw our base appear between the thickly placed trees, I was hit with a powerful surge of exhaustion. It felt like we had only been fighting the Goose for an hour at most, but apparently, it had been the entirety of the day. I chose to ignore this in favor of collapsing on the ground next to the unlit fire. I was way too tired to want to light it. I heard WX let out an audible groan of annoyance before starting to do so himself. By the time his system overcharge had worn off, the fire was large enough to chase away the monsters in the night. Take that Mom, Dad came those thoughts that I suppressed so hard. The thoughts that I buried beneath observations and theories and concerns during the day- they always came back out at night. Right on that borderline edge between awake and asleep, just a couple of them would leak through. I told you I could be strong.

I told you I wasn't useless.

…

I was running through a maze. How long had I been wandering through this twisting and turning labyrinth? I couldn't remember. High walls surrounded me on all sides, threatening to trap me forever in stone and marble.

My eyes were dazzled by a flash of light in front of me- a bright, dancing orange light, that threw orange spots in my vision until I got used to the lightning. The fire was burning on top of two pillars, with no rhyme nor reason as to how they continued to burn. I puzzled over this phenomenon, frowning at these pillars until my eyes hurt.

Which is probably why it took me so long to see the creature that was standing just on the edge of the shadows cast by the fire. I recognized it- the tall, slim figure that had sent me and my group on the quest to kill the giants in the first place. It was still cloaked in shadows, probably the reason why it was standing in the darkness instead of the light just paces in front of it. I was kind of afraid of what it would look like in the light anyway.

“One down, scientist. Four more to go,” it said in that weird, warping voice of its. It rose its clawed hand, tiny black flames that gave off no light flickering at their tips. With the slightest flick of its wrist, one of these flames sputtered out.

I stepped forward, shivering at the unnatural way my shoes clicked against the floor, and it continued speaking.

“Your next fight will be the hardest." It gave me a scrutinizing glance as if it didn't quite believe I was cut out to be fighting. "But I assume you already know this.”

I took a deep breath. “Summer. The Dragonfly. Two tons of pure muscles and scales and fire. With claws that can impale even the strongest of hides.”

“It's a shame the fight has to be so soon. If it were just the two of you, you could easily last long enough to fight it after you've had more experience. You two are strong, but I know one of you... who isn't.” It shook its head, making a clicking noise with its tongue. “Keep your eyes peeled, scientist. Not everything here is as it seems...”

I was thrown out of the dream rather violently. Cold sweat dotted my face and back, but the heat from the fire and the soon-to-be-rising sun was already beginning to dispel the fear I had felt in facing that creature. Why did I fear it so much? It didn't seem particularly evil in any fashion, and it certainly had done nothing but helped us so far.

But there was something I couldn't shake off. Some underlying fear of it that made me cautious of its mere existence. It was hard to explain, but just being near it felt like I was standing near a tear in the fabric of space-time, something that should not- and should never- exist. I should probably be waking up now anyway, I thought blandly. But I barely got any sleep... I glanced quickly at Webber, who was only a foot or two away from me, curled into his typical ball and snoring softly. He didn't seem like he was going to wake up soon anyway... Shrugging my shoulders, I let myself fall back asleep. The sky was stained pink and red and orange with the rise of the sun. All night, while the others slept, I had watched the sky. Sometimes, counting the stars, but most often just letting my mind wander. Wilson had seemed happy, but also uncomfortable, at the fact that we had killed the Goose, but I couldn't tell what Webber felt. Every time I had looked at him there had been a different expression on his face. Grief one time, glee another, shock, then fear, then guilt, then excitement. I hated to think about it, but I had felt truly overjoyed at seeing the beast fall. Some part of me that I was trying desperately (and more often than not failing) to salvage hated it simply for being a living, breathing creature. So what if it had a nest to take care of? If we had let those moslings live, they would've grown up to be just as much trouble as their mother. Another part of me, that was decidedly my own thoughts, so take that Wilson, wondered if I should be more sad about it. However, even if I tried, I couldn't muster any guilt for it.

The beast had deserved to die. It was more trouble than it was worth. If we had not killed it, it would've killed us. It was simply the circle of life. The new day reminded me that I was, in fact, existing. I shook my head, only slightly, before turning my gaze disdainfully to the other two of my group. They were still asleep, of course. Weak. But the thought wasn't as scornful as it usually was. Of course, they were going to be exhausted. It was not their fault. It was the fault of their weak, fleshy and far too easy to harm bodies.

What if one of us had died in that battle? Could the other two make it out without them? If I had died, could they make it without my brute strength? Could Wilson and I make it without Webber's... whatever he contributed to the group? Of course, I mentally added. I could make it by myself.

But was that entirely true? All of us had suffered painfully for our arrogance in the winter.

Stop. Stop doubting yourself. That was a single case. An unlucky one, at that.

The rising sun caught the fragment of the Goose's egg, glinting like a tiny sun. Wilson had been clutching it to his chest when he had fallen asleep, but his grip had, by now, loosened enough to where it fell onto the dirt beside him. I hesitated, then slowly began to inch closer to them. I had not touched it since Wilson had retrieved in, primarily due to my lack of caring about it beforehand. I retrieved it, studying it closely and holding it up into the light. To my surprise, it was not just a solid color. Small fragments of something black and green glittered in the pale blue surface, looking quite like distant stars in the midnight sky.

I frowned, just a little. There were so few stars in this world, even on the clearest of nights. Where did I see that...?

Instinctively, I looked up at the brightening sky. There were many things that the old sky held that this one didn't. For one, I had a very faint, vague memory of clouds that appeared in light fluffs. Here, the sky was either clear and sunny or mostly covered in thick, foreboding gray clouds.

Sometimes, it was hard for me to realize that I had only been built in the past four or five years and that the time to form new memories was short. We had not even been in this world for an incredibly long time, but already my memories of our home world were beginning to fade. I looked back to the other two members of my group. Wilson never talked about a family or friends, yet he seemed to fancy escape just as much as I did. He never really spoke of how he got here; He tended to focus on what was happening and what needed to be done at the current moment.

Webber was an enigma. The way he threw himself into the brunt of the action, always eager to strike the first blow, to spill first blood, was oftentimes useful for our gain. Yet, he almost never spoke of freedom. It was easy for me to forget how young he was, despite the fact that he was the smallest of all of us. He was a magnet for trouble, of course, the most likely to shatter his legs or get pushed into the ocean in the middle of winter or literally any other stupid thing, but he also didn't show the same passion that Wilson and I shared to escape.

A soft, almost-but-not-quite barking sound jogged me from my thoughts. My gaze rested on Chester, the sentient pumpkin-creature had idly hopped up to me, and now it panted expectantly like I was the most likely candidate to give it a rub or a pat. I stared at it with disdain. I had my misgivings about keeping the little creature, but truthfully enough it was fairly easy to ignore, or even forget about. In fact, the only times I ever really saw it was when it had bounced out of the shadows to rest by the fire. Despite the fact that we held the item that summoned it, it rarely showed up. Good. It had better stay that way.

I didn't plan on giving it the pet that it obviously wanted. I looked up at the rising sun, letting out a quiet, static sigh. My team would be waking soon.

I stopped.

My team? Did I think of them like that now? Sure, I greatly appreciated their help at times, not that I would ever tell them, but did we truly work as a team? I had always pictured a team working like cogs in a machine, linking and moving and humming and working together, all the time, to make something greater. We fought, we argued- we were nothing alike. We even let our arrogance split us apart at one of the roughest times of the year.

Despite this, we had killed the Goose. Despite all of our pettiness and grudges, we had set that all aside in the heat of battle. I closed my eyes, leaning my head back and letting the sound of the early morning birds chirping and squawking as they flew down to the ground and searched for seeds to eat.

…

Intermission: Kyra's Pack

Kyra and Shatter padded side-by-side in the back of a hunting party. Her pup bounded beside her, his little pink tongue hanging out from the side of his mouth. "Where're we goin', mamma?" The newly named ice hound chirped in question, looking up cheerfully at Kyra's face. She gave him an affectionate lick on the side of his face. He was growing big, but he was still as eager as a tiny puppy. This would be his very first hunting mission- it wasn't anything dangerous, Varg would never send a warrior-in-training on a mission that could take his or her life before they were fully grown, just an expedition out to the rabbit holes, but she still worried deeply for him and his safety.

Shatter- the original Shatter- had died before the survivors had become prevalent to the pack. Sometimes, Kyra had heard Varg mention that this was a shame for multiple reasons, not just because an expectant mother had lost her mate, but also because if anyone could take on a group of survivors and win, it was Shatter. She knew very well that this is what his plans were for her pup. This was merely a trial run. If he did well here, then Varg would know he was almost old enough for a proper hunting party.

She wasn't sure if Varg would wait until he was at least fully grown before sending him against the survivors.

He wouldn't be that inane, she hoped. Sending a small pup against the survivors? Not even Varg would expect that to work well. Her nose twitched as she caught the powerful scent of rabbit meat. Sizzle, the fire hound pup, hung back for a moment to walk beside Shatter. “Are you excited for your first hunting mission?” Her voice was kind and soft, easily the gentler of the siblings. Then again, compared to the ever-rowdy Ebony, perhaps that wasn't a hard title to gain.

“Am I ever!” Shatter exclaimed, hopping between his feet. His icy blue fur was practically glowing in the sunlight, as were his wide, silver eyes.

“Hush,” Hailstorm hissed. The ice hound was leading the party, his fur brushed out slightly as the smell of meat washed over them all. “Take your positions. I want each of you to lead your prey into Shatter's paws. The success of this hunt will determine young Shatter's place in the rankings.”

“What about me, sir?” Kyra stepped forward, beside her pup. Shatter was quivering with excitement, his paws eagerly kneading the ground in anticipation.

“Take his back,” Hailstorm instructed. “We can't fail a hunt just to train a pup. Try to catch any rabbits that he misses. Alright, pack, positions!” He let out a short, quiet bark, and at once, the entire party split into different directions. Shatter flattened his body to the ground, whining excitedly. She could see black and blue shapes moving among the grass. A singular red-tinted one slunk beside a black-furred hound as Sizzle followed \her own instructions. There were few rabbits still about due to the season, but a small handful of them had dug free of their burrows to store more food to last the spring. They moved as one, a full force rather than its separate parts. When they broke free of their carefully created circle, they all ran together, quickly eliminating all escape routes that could possibly be used by their prey.

Shatter worked surprisingly well considering his young age. He was fast on his feet as the first rabbit plowed its way to him. Kyra held her breath as he leaped, pinning down the rabbit solidly and biting its scruff, growling. Another rabbit swerved past him and straight into Kyra's jaws. He released the rabbit he had and clamped his teeth around its neck.

“That's all!” A sturdy, female hound shouted. She had a dead rabbit at her feet.

“Excellent job!” Hailstorm called. “Varg will be pleased!”

Shatter dropped onto his haunches, his tongue sticking out of his mouth. “Did I do good, momma?” He chirped. His mouth was stained with blood from his kills, and his teeth were partially showing from his half-open mouth. Kyra took a step back, her brow creasing with worry. Shatter's excitement faded as he saw her reaction. “Did I do something wrong?”

“N-no,” she stammered. He's a hunter at heart. He is just like his father. Varg's... Varg's going to... send him out... "No, pup, you did fantastically." Her words caught in her throat. Oh Varg, I'm begging you! Please don't send him against the survivors! I couldn't live with myself if something happened to him! "One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand..." Our face was buried in the darkly colored bark of an old pine tree. Our breath was hot and moist on our fur. "Twenty-one thousand... twenty-one one thousand... twenty-two one thousand..." The thrill of the hunt was boiling in our blood. Our claws twitched with excitement. "Forty-eight one thousand... forty-nine one thousand... fifty! Ready or not, here we come!" We leaped away from the tree, our eyes closed tightly as we breathed heavily in, then out. Our whiskers twitched with concentration. Then, finally, we sucked in a breath that brought us the scent of our target. Turning on our heel, we took a final moment to determine where the scent was coming from before dropping to all fours and running. The fresh spring air blasted us in the face and we weaved around obstacles with nary a thought. We threw up mud and dirt in our wake.

We broke into the desert, the hot sand feeling nice against our chilly, damp feet. Buzzard cawed overhead as we kept low to the ground. We could see him now, sitting in the sand just over a ridge. The sun glinted brightly off of him. He seemed deeply lost in thought. We licked out chops and slunk closer, whiskers twitching intensely.

Closer... closer... closer...

Then, we were leaping, crashing into WX-78 as hard as our inertia would allow, bowling him over. He let out a shout of indignation, twisting and burying his foot deep into our ribs. We bared our teeth. “Scared ya', didn't we?”

WX grunted with annoyance. He pushed us off and brushed the sand off of himself. “I COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE SCARED BY YOU.”

“Yup! We scared you!” The desert was quickly drying the water that had gathered on our fur. “Whatcha doing out here?”

“GETTING AWAY FROM YOU.” The robot frowned deeply and crossed his arms. “WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE DOING?”

“Wilson told us to explore a bit,” I explained.

“SINCE WHEN DO YOU FOLLOW ORDERS?” WX huffed.

“When there's nothing else to do and we planned on exploring anyway.” We shook the sand off of ourself. “And, to be fair, we aren't following orders! We're following you!”

"WELL, YOU CAN FOLLOW THIS!” The robot picked up a stick and threw it. We stared at it for a long moment, then back at him.

“Really?”

He threw his arms in the air in frustration. “DON'T YOU HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE TO ANNOY?”

“Nope! Come on! Let's explore!”

WX crossed his arms and growled. “FINE.” He turned angrily away, marching past. We grinned, counting it as a victory, and followed. Much of the walk was spent in silence, which eventually devolved into awkwardness. He seemed upset about something, but we couldn't be bothered to care. We were jogged out of our thoughts by the sound of a low, distant rumble. WX paused, looking confused.

“It's an earthquake,” I informed him. “Just underground. It shouldn't bother us.”

Turns out, the world didn't like it when you claimed that it did something harmless. Despite the many times we had fought, it was easy to forget how heavy the robot actually was. We were cresting a hill when we saw WX stumble slightly in the corner of our vision.

Then, the ground crumbled away beneath him.

He let out a short exclamation of surprise, quickly cut off by the thick darkness below.

“WX!” I cried, lunging forward to grab his hand. Of course, a seven-year-old trying to hold up a robot that was easily over a ton didn't work very well, and it only succeeded in sending us both into the hole.

The darkness swallowed us both, but it wasn't until we hit the bottom that everything went dark.

…

Blackness. Shadows. We opened our eyes groggily to see nothing but a tiny beam of light above our heads. We slowly rolled over, groaning at the ache reverberating through our whole body. “WX?” I croaked, before instantly dissolving into a fit of coughs. “WX, are you okay?”

We managed to drag ourself to our knees, waiting for our eyes to adjust.

"I'M HERE," came the rough voice as WX dragged himself closer to the light. He looked worse for wear but otherwise fine.

“Any idea where we are?”

WX's eyeless gaze slowly drifted down. “YOU'RE BLEEDING.”

We touched our chest, only to bring our hand away soaked in blood. “...guess we are.” We flicked our hand, tiny droplets scattering the ground. “That doesn't matter right now. We're just glad that both of us are alright. We need to get out of here.”

A hiss drifted from the shadows, announcing the arrival of someone new. A spider. WX stiffened as if startled, but we found a tiny spark of hope. "Hello?" I hissed in his language. “Who are you? Can you help us leave?”

Two red eyes slowly neared.

“What are you?” The spider spat back as it finally made itself shown. It was completely white sans its bright red eyes. It moved carefully and precisely. Its mouth was twisted in a snarl. “You aren't one of us.”

It hit, but we didn't let it show. “Is there a problem with that?”
“Surface spiders aren't welcome here.” The spider snarled. It slowly stalked closer to WX, who appeared to be readying himself to attack. “Nor is your kind.”

“Hold on, WX.” We waved him off. “We just want to leave.”

It turned to the ceiling and let out a long, loud hiss.

Thousands of eyes opened in unison.

We slowly stepped back until we backed into WX.

“BACK AWAY YOU PESTS!” The robot shouted.

We can take out... maybe twenty together? But that's way more than twenty... We quickly assessed our options. We couldn't run or else risk angering the monster of the dark...

“Don't touch them!”

We snapped our gaze upward as one of the spiders broke away from the legions, shoving the leader angrily. This one's eyes were closer to pink than red, and her voice was distinctly feminine.

“Father, they did not mean to intrude! They fell from the surface! Just let them go!”

There was something... familiar... about her?

A girl with sparkling amber eyes, grabbing my hand and jumping up and down with glee. Gleeful laughter pierced my ears.

The leader shifted his gaze carefully across both of us, before resting them on the newcomer. “Erika, this is not your place,” he growled. “You have no right to interrupt me.”
“I do, when you're about to kill two innocent victims of M-” she cut herself off. “Him. Besides, look at him! He's injured! They both are!”

“WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?” WX growled softly.

“Debating our life or death,” I replied grimly.

“Ignore my father,” 'Erika' sighed, flicking one of her front legs. “You're welcome here! Come with me! Let's fix you up!”

“Erika, you may be my daughter but you are not in charge here.”

“He's kind of a killjoy at times.” Erika winked. “We can fix up that wound, but... that.... what is that?”

“Someone we're stuck with for the rest of our lives,” I replied with a grin. Startling ourself, we reached up and touched the edge of our grin. …Why are we... smiling? “He pretends to hate me, but we're absolute best friends.”

“O... kay? He's going to have to stay here. My voice isn't loud enough to tell the entire colony to stay away.” She turned and beckoned us.

"...WX, would you mind staying here for a while? We shouldn't be long."

A knowing look passed over his face and twisted into a sneer. “OH, I UNDERSTAND. YOU WANT SOME PRIVACY.” We tipped our head in confusion. “ALL RIGHT. GO HAVE FUN. BUT NOT TOO MUCH FUN.”

“...what?” We would've protested more, but our wound was really starting to bite. “You know what? Nevermind...”

The leading spider was grumbling angrily, but Erika ignored him. She bounded into the darkness, but we hesitated, unconsciously shifting closer to WX. “

“We... can't go into the darkness. The mo-”

“She won't touch you here,” Erika cut us off. “There's- actually, I think it'd be cooler to let you see yourself!”

We looked into the darkness, feeling as if we were directly staring down the monster of the dark herself. ...we trust her. I don't know why, but we do. “Alright. Lead the way. We'll... be back soon, WX. Don't get too lonely.”

Before the robot could even respond, Erika eagerly pushed us into the dark, her grumbling father following behind.

…

We could understand now why Erika was unconcerned about the monster of the dark. The darkness only lasted for a short time before red light suddenly flooded the area. We took a disoriented step back as spots danced in our vision. Erika looked amused. “Yeah, a lot of outsiders react that way.”

“Didn't your father say that no outsiders were allowed here?”

“He's all bark and no bite,” Erika said dismissively. The rest of the spider army had gone to do other activities, but that didn't stop the occasional skitter of spider claws behind us. No matter what we felt or thought, we would never be alone in these caves. “Slinger! Come over here! We've got a wound that needs tending to. Slinger is our medic,” Erika explained. “He can speak twenty-four languages, including everything from tallbird to hound.”

“Yes, Erika!” Another snow-white spider dropped from the ceiling, nearly right in front of our feet. We yelped then quickly brushed ourself off in an attempt to keep our composure. Erika let out a giggle. “Oh boy, that's a pretty bad wound. How are you walking right now? Hey Slasher, come look at this guy!”

“Yeah, boss! That's a pretty bad one. You should probably do something about it.”

We glanced uncomfortably at the ceiling. How many spiders were hiding up there, out of sight, watching our every move?

“Alright, alright, let's get you fixed up! Come with me, come with me!”

We followed him, slower this time. Was it wrong to choose to go with the spiders? Were we about to get eaten alive? Spiders weren't strangers to cannibalism- we remember with a sickening twist in our stomach... the bitter, rotten taste of spider meat sitting in our otherwise empty belly like a lead ball...- and they definitely were not strangers to trapping each other and group-attacking them. Uh oh. We're about to get eaten by our own kind. Eat your hearts out, spiders! You're gonna get a huge surprise once you get past the tough, outer, chewy layer!

“This might sting a little,” Slinger stated, before quickly and efficiently binding the wound on our chest with silk. We decided not to think about where the silk came from. However the method, soon, the weak blood flow was staunched, and Slinger stepped back to examine his work. “There! All nice and clean!”

We gently touched the makeshift bandage. “...thank you.”

“No problem, weird-looking spider! Come on, Slasher!”

“Of course, boss!”

After they left, we were left along with Erika.

Well, Erika and the four thousand spiders watching our every move.

“So... um... could you show us to the surface now?”

Erika laughed. “With that wound? Of course not.”

Yup, we're definitely going to become this spider's lunch.

We've lived for seven years. That's a... well, not 'long' but it was a life I guess.

“Just get some rest, and you'll be better in no time! Good night, er...”

“Webber.” But the name didn't sound right and there was an intense want to say something different but there was nothing different to say.

“Webber. Huh. You've probably already heard my name a hundred times, but it's Erika.”

Snow battering my face as the winter chill turned my nose red. Snow condensed into a ball colliding with the back of my head. We turned away, trying to drive away the half-formed and fuzzy memories. “Goodnight Erika,” I murmured, curling up on the silk beneath and closing our eyes.

“When was the last time I slept on silk? Oh, it's been so, so long! I've missed it. I'm surprised that she is still alive, I will not deny. After... you know.”

What?? What are you talking about??

“...nevermind.” A small chuckle resonated in the back of our head. “You'll find out soon enough.”

…

Slinger hummed and hurmed at the gash we received from the fall. The 'dangling depth dweller', as Erika had explained them to be called, clapped his front legs together. “You should be able to return to the surface today!”

We perked up, our eyes widening. “Really?” While only two days had passed, it was hard not to have gotten sick of the never-ending darkness. We only knew how much time had gone by because of Erika.

“Erika! It's time for our guest to leave,” Slinger called into the darkness. His cry was almost instantly answered by the pink-eyed dangling depth dweller. She looked almost... sad? Nostalgic?

“Already? Yes, yes, you have your friends on the surface to tend to.” She tapped on the floor, then forcibly brightened. “Well, I guess this is goodbye until you and your friend fall down here again!”

“Until then,” I responded with a smile. We hesitated, then added: “will you be the one to show us the way out?”

“Of course.” Her expression softened, but she shook her body as if to scatter thoughts. “Come on! The Nightmare Lights won't stay lit forever. We only have a short amount of time.” The white spider turned and scurried away, but her rush shocked us. There's something off about her. I'm not the only one that feels it... I couldn't help but tap my foot expectantly as Webber walked towards me with his head down. While WX had returned to camp the same day he had left, the spider had been gone for two days. WX had held the information of his whereabouts over my head for his own amusement, which I wasn't surprised about. It didn't make me any less worried about him, though. It's a dangerous world. It's not safe for any of us to be out alone. “Well? Where were you?”

“Um... dying...” the spider mumbled. “Probably?”

I raised my eyebrow at him.

“We weren't in danger,” he said quickly. “We-uh- were with other spiders. We fell through the hill with WX and got a nasty injury on our chest.”

“HE HAD A CRUSH ON ONE OF THEM,” WX added with a sneer.

“Did not!” Webber growled, but I cut him off before another argument could surface.

“Alright, alright, don't even start. Webber, I really don't like that you were out that long without telling me where you were.” I crossed my arms. Despite the fact that he acted independently, he was still a young child, and he still had to learn rules and discipline. His jaw dropped in anger.

“What were we supposed to tell you? They literally would not let us leave!” Webber stomped his foot, puffing his cheeks out and his whiskers twitching.

“You've survived a lot worse than a gash to the chest,” I pointed out. “We've been here for less than a year and you've probably already broken half of the bones in your body. Surely you could've left any time you wanted to, even if they didn't let you.”

“Why are you treating us like a child?” Webber fumed. “We've survived by ourself for years before!”

“Because you are a child, Webber!”

"Well, you're not our pa! You have no right to tell us what to do! If we want to spend some time with our own kind, then let us!"

“I may not be your father, but you should be glad about that! If I was your father, I would've washed your mouth out with soap by now!”

“We'd love to see you try!”

“WILSON,” WX spoke up, startling me out of my glare-off with the spider boy. “YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO KEEP A LEASH ON HIM. IF HE WANTS TO KILL HIMSELF, LET HIM.”

I pinched the bridge of my nose, letting out a long sigh. “You're right, WX. I just worry about both of you, alright? We need each other. Webber, I'm sorry I yelled at you. I was- grr, I was really worried about you! WX wouldn't tell me where you were! I seriously thought you were dead!”

Webber's shoulders relaxed slightly, and he lowered his head again. “...it's okay. We just... really... we are independent. You know that, right?”

I sighed once more and shook my head. You aren't! None of us are! Why don't you understand that! “Go get something to eat.”

“Yes, Wilson.” He turned and scampered off, leaving me alone with WX. I turned to the robot with an incredulous expression.

“He doesn't get it.”

“HE IS YOUNG,” WX replied, surprising me with the touch of fondness in the comment. “HE WILL LEARN.” The robot shook his head. “IT HAS BEEN GETTING WARM. SUMMER IS COMING.”

“I'm aware. I'm not looking forward to it...” I shook my head fiercely. “But it doesn't matter! We've survived this long! At this point, our exquisite master may as well give us the key out.” I cracked my knuckles, choosing not to read WX's expression. I didn't need to see his doubt. “I know the book says that the Dragonfly is the strongest of all of the Giants, but I call bologna. It's stupid to have the hardest enemy be the second one we fight.”

“...I SUPPOSE. WHILE YOUR OPTIMISM IS SICKENING I CANNOT HELP BUT WONDER IF THAT IS WHAT HAS GOTTEN YOU THIS FAR.”

“Wow! We missed the taste of rabbit!” Webber exclaimed, rejoining us. His hands were covered with red juice that he was contently licking off. “Slurper may be good but it will never beat the peaty taste of a goo-”

“Hush,” I cut him off, aggressively motioning my hand towards him to stop. He paused with his hand in mid-air. “...do you hear that?”

Whiskers twitching, Webber closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. “Hounds. Seven of them. Coming from...” he paused, then pointed in the direction of the savanna. “Over there.” He looked baffled for a moment. “We... there's a tinge that we can't quite make out...”

I hoisted my morning star over my shoulder, watching carefully in the direction that Webber had pointed. I was surprised by how much I trusted the boy's sense of hearing and smell, but there wasn't time to really think about it. Webber gripped his knife closely to his chest while WX chose not to take a weapon. The robot's heavy weight allowed for him to give rather heavy blows as well, and his hands obviously did not break down like a weapon would, so he had been using his fists more and more as of late. For a long moment, there was only the faint sound of the wind and mine and Webber's breathing, along with the very, very faint churning of metallic parts working together.

Then, the first hound broke through the tree line. Webber growled deep in his throat, his muscles bunching, but I was too shocked to respond for the longest moment. That's a huge hound! And it's BLUE! Why is it BLUE? Behind it were five black hounds, tailed by another blue one, this one substantially smaller. Is that a puppy? I felt a tinge of guilt. We have to fight a puppy? Maxwell, how cold can you get?? I didn't have enough time to feel too bad though, because the front runner had reached us.

Teeth like icicles gleamed in the sun as it lunged for my chest. Readying myself, I swung my morning star in a wide arc and hit the side of its face with a sickening crack! It went flying but managed to land on its paws anyway, its furry chest heaving. Fire blazed in its hungry gaze, but I could see something more. Are... are they sentient? No, don't be stupid, Wilson. Animals are animals. They can't think or care any more than a rock can. Before I could renew my attack, the second blue hound latched onto my ankle, causing me to collapse. Its fur was as cold as snow, and despite its small size, it was rather heavy. I hit the ground heavily, losing my weapon in the process in favor of trying to pry it off.

It let out an excited yelp as it realized that it had the upper hand, and clamped onto my hand. It tossed its head back and forth, growling, and I couldn't help but feel dizzy with relief that it was just a puppy. If it had been a fully grown hound, it could've easily taken my whole arm off. I could still feel its jagged teeth digging into my skin though, and the blood pooling around its teeth told me enough about the state of my hand.

Then, it released me with a howl. I blinked rapidly, my racing mind taking a second to recover from the attack, but I was just in time to see why it had stopped.

WX stood over the bloody body of the largest hound. The rest of the hounds lay, lifeless, on the ground around them, and I realized that he and Webber had taken all of them out in the time it took for me to nearly get nibbled to death by a puppy. Its blue fur was so stained in its own blood that it was hard to make out what color it was anymore. The puppy had released me in favor of nudging and whining at the hound's body. My stomach lurched in horror of the realization, and I turned to see the exact expression over Webber's face. His jaw dropped and he looked absolutely devastated. If he was anyone else, I would've expected to see the boy crying.

“You killed its momma!” Webber cried, glaring accusingly at WX.

“IT'S 'MOMMA' WAS TRYING TO KILL US!” WX snapped back, glaring at the puppy with disdain. “AND SO WAS THIS STUPID CREATURE.” He brought his arm back as if to finish off the hound pup, but Webber caught the robot's hand before he could. WX gave him a nasty look.

“Don't kill it! It's- it's just a baby!”

“OH?” WX sounded incredibly amused. “SHOULD I PICK IT UP AND KISS IT AND MAKE IT ALL BETTER?” His voice dripped with sarcasm.

Webber looked at me with a pained expression. “Wilson, we can't kill it!”

“It's just an animal, Webber. It's not like they have feelings any more than a rock or insect does.”

Hurt flared in his eyes, and he looked sharply away. I was confused. Did I offend him or something?

"Is that all we are, then?!" He exploded, snapping his gaze back towards me. His fur bristled and his whiskers were twitching like crazy. "Are we just an emotionless insect, Wilson?”
GAH how do you make it SO EASY TO FORGET WHAT YOU ARE?

“That's- that's not what I meant and you know it!”

His fur flattened a little, but he didn't look any less upset. He just looked... he looks sad... he looks so sad.

“Webber.” I tried to make my voice as gentle as possible. I rested my hand on the boy's shoulder. “What else could we do with a hound? They're born and bred to kill. Just because this one is smaller doesn't mean it's any less capable of killing.”

“Spiders are too. We're also born to kill, and you still let us stay around. Why couldn't we make an exception for this puppy?”

I gave WX a 'please-help-me-look'. “DO NOT LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT, SCIENTIST. THIS IS YOUR MESS TO CLEAN UP.”

I sighed. “Webber, we couldn't care for another pet. We already have Chester, and he eats enough for four animals.” I attempted to lighten the mood. As if to solidify my comment, the little orange beast let out a bark from his spot by the fire.

Webber said nothing, only breaking away from me and slowly nearing the hound. As he did, the puppy shied away, but Webber was able to gently touch the top of its head. It almost seemed to melt into the touch, closing its eyes and turning its cheek for Webber's claws to stroke. Webber closed his eyes, then stood up, his gaze burning with determination. “Okay, if we can't appeal to your emotional side, then think about it logically. We'll have a sentry to keep watch at night while we sleep. Hounds may not attack us as often or badly if they risk hurting one of their own kind. We could train this puppy to hunt, Wilson. It's obviously built to withstand the cold, and you remember how horrible the winter was with hunting.”

I rubbed my temples, trying to force myself to say no, but he was making legitimate points. “...you'll be responsible for training and feeding it?”

Webber perked up. “O-of course!”

WX scowled.

“Fine. If you want to keep it, it's yours. But if that hound takes one step out of line, we're going to have to get rid of it.”

“Really, Wilson?” Webber sounded more childlike than I ever heard him sound. “Oh thank you thank you thank you!!” He barreled towards me and hugged me as fiercely as he could. I let out a nervous laugh and patted his head, unsure of what else to do. Webber seemed to notice how impulsive the action was and he broke away almost immediately, blushing fiercely in embarrassment beneath his fur. “Um... yes, very... very smart to agree... it would be stupid not to...” he hiccuped, choosing to stroke the hound pup without looking back at me. I smiled. Oh, Webber, you don't have to act big and tough all the time. You're allowed to act like your age.

“YOU'RE SERIOUS, WILSON?”

“Hey, you didn't protest so I figured the decision was up to me.”

“IT IS A KILLING MACHINE! IT IS DESIGNED TO WANT TO KILL US.”

“So are you, and yet we keep you around,” I responded cheekily. “What have you always wanted to name a pet?” I asked Webber as he grew bolder in petting the newest addition to the group.

“Popsicle!” The spider boy responded without any hesitation. “He feels like a little popsicle, you know? His fur is all cold.”

I smiled, surprising myself at how the boy's excitement bled into me. "...Popsicle. All right."

This hound was still small, but something was telling me that he wouldn't stay that way for long. If the size of his mother was anything to say by it, he would be very strong. Maybe this was actually a good idea. Maybe this was a stroke of luck, that we are taking in this hound.

Maybe Popsicle is going to give us the edge we need. “Kyra!”

The female ice hound glanced up, fur sticking up along her back. That was my mother. She was the strongest hound in the whole pack. Or so, that's what I had been told several times over by almost all of the bigger hounds I knew. She looked worried, deeply worried as if something horrible had happened.

She told me the story of how she and my father had joined the Varg's pack. They were once a pair of hunting hounds owned by a walrus by the name of Mactusk. After a particularly harsh winter followed by a summer far too hot to make up on the lost hunting, and they had been given up. They had traveled together for a while until Varg's pack found them hunting a beefalo together. They had joined in hopes of providing the best life possible for them and their future pups. While my father had passed before I was even born, though, I carried his spirit in my name.

I was proud to carry this name. I was still small, but I was growing quickly. Soon, I knew, I would be big enough to join my first dangerous hunting party.

I didn't realize how soon it was.

Varg was incredibly massive and incredibly terrifying. His eyes were white and beady, and today they were flaring with either excitement or anger or both.

“Shatter did very well in his first hunting assignment,” Varg began.

Momma dipped her head, looking... worried? “He did.”

“Shatter, are you interested in joining another hunting party? This one will be much more dangerous, but should you succeed, you will be hailed a hero.”

Kyra looked as if she were about to speak, but she clamped her jaw shut and glanced at me instead. “...This is your choice, pup. You're old enough to have a name, and you are old enough to make your own decisions.”

“Your mother is right, young hound.” Varg's eyes glimmered. “Will you join the party against the survivors?”

"Will I!?" I exclaimed, quivering with excitement. "O-Of course!" I hesitated, then broke into a bow as I had seen the other pups before I do to address their leader. "I-It would be an honor to serve you!"

“Kyra, I expect that you would like to go with Shatter,” Varg continued, and the female hound dipped her head in agreement. “And... Ebony, Coal, Midnight, Ash...” The mighty beast lowered his head in thought. “Pitch.” The five black hounds barked to show their acknowledgment and lined up in front of Varg. My mother gently nudged me from behind, encouraging me to join them. I did, but slowly. Kyra joined them, and I stood beside her. Varg paced down the line, sniffing each of us in turn. He stopped at me, his beady eyes freezing me in my spot. “You're young, but you're strong. I've seen the way you can hunt and fight, and I trust in your ability to do this.” A huge paw touched the top of my head. “You have your father's strength.” He turned back to the pack. “These hounds will return victorious over the intruders of our hunting land!”

Yelps and bellows of triumph echoed over the group. I felt my chest puff with pride. This is my pack. I'm going to fight for my pack!

“You will leave immediately,” Varg rumbled. “Good luck. The faith of the pack follows you.”

The other hounds pounded the ground and barked, including my mother. I found myself deflating slightly, seeing the passion and strength in all of their shoulders and backs. It was rather obvious that I was the odd one out, but before I could say anything to mom, they were moving. Kyra naturally took the lead, and I was awed by the muscles rolling under her fur. I had never realized how strong my mother was.

We will do this! My mother is the biggest, strongest hound in the whole pack!

I will make you proud! Our camp was flooded. The rain was pounding against the branches above, roaring somehow even louder than the thunder. It had been going on for several days now, driving us uphill from our home.

WX was very frustrated with it. Well, 'frustrated' was sort of an understatement. In fact, he was quite angry with it. Given his weakness to it, he was rendered practically useless by it.

We had spent a great deal of time with the puppy, Popsicle. He didn't get along at all with Chester. In fact, they seemed to hate each other. Every time the ice hound neared Chester, Chester's fur would rise, and he would, surprisingly, start to snarl. Popsicle had simply stared at him and tipped his head in confusion but had eventually slunk back to us.

We loved having Popsicle around. Once he had broken out of his shell, he became a very good companion. He was playful and sweet and absolutely adored having his belly rubbed, all the things that Chester typically hated. And most of all, he was ours.

We had had pets before. Mainly, we remembered our mother having a pet catcoon, but he hated us. Plus, we never were a fan of catcoons.

No, Popsicle... this was the pet we always wanted. The ice hound puppy lazily cleaned his paw, his blue fur sparkling with water droplets. He loved playing in the water, and he already proved to be a good hunter. He left came early one morning and returned with a rabbit. It was a bit of a messy kill, but we couldn't blame him. We were surprised that he left and came back. That's when we realized that he really was ours. Due to the intensity of the rain, we had enough time to tie together enough flowers to make him his own personal collar.

Today, however, there was something else on our mind.

“I highly doubt this is the first flood those cave spiders have ever seen,” Wilson pointed out, his arms crossed. His hair was wet, but surprisingly, it was still standing in his signature style, albeit a bit messier. “They'll be perfectly fine.”

“We don't know that,” I grumbled, picking at the ground. We were desperately worried about the group of spiders, even though it occurred to us that we really shouldn't be. They had practically kept us as a prisoner for two days for little reason, but we still couldn't get feeling out of our head. That feeling of recognizing the dangling depth dweller, Erika. We shook our head, sighing. We wouldn't get any answers sitting in the rain. Besides, it was probably more important to worry about the state of our camp. “We do have everything we need from camp, right?”

“I made sure to get the egg shard,” he responded distractedly as if not realizing that this was the third time we had asked this question. “And the book.” He retrieved it from his bag, easily the only dry thing we had. “I found my new favorite line in it. On the page about hounds, it says 'Beware at all costs'. Strange to think that this is talking about the same thing as Popsicle.”

The hound's ears perked up as he heard his name, and he looked up from his paw grooming. It was sometimes hard to realize that the puppy would soon grow to be one of the most feared creatures in the world.

“WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY IT SHOULD NOT BE HERE,” WX spoke up. “WE SHOULD HAVE KILLED IT WHEN WE HAD THE CHANCE.”

“You probably shouldn't be threatening our pet when you can't even move three inches without turning into a Winter's Feast tree.”

A moment passed before WX let out a burst of garbled static. Laughter, we supposed. “YOU CANNOT EVEN PROCESS THE CORRECT NAME FOR A HOLIDAY.”

We puffed out our cheeks but chose not to correct him. If he was too stupid to know that that was the correct name, then he would always be too stupid. We were jarred from our thoughts by the cold muzzle of Popsicle nuzzling our arm for affection. We felt a small smile grow on our face as we scratched behind the hound's ears.

We felt a twinge in the back of our head, causing us to wince. Popsicle let out a slight whine as if concerned. That familiar voice in the back of our head whispered:

“Flowers will grow and rain will fall

So raise your head and stand up tall

As spring is here and winter's gone

So let the flowers flower on”

We recognized the tune. It was a simple nursery rhyme- one that we remembered well. In fact... It was the nursery rhyme that mum used to sing to me when it was raining.

How do you know that?

“Obvious reasons.”

Why did you just sing it?

"Because I'm getting awfully tired of hearing your brain work in circles. I figured a familiar tune would kick-start your old memories. I see it partially worked. Think harder, please. For my benefit."

Why can't you just tell me what this is about?

“It is much more fun this way. And more satisfying in the long run.”

I remember... there was someone else, wasn't there? There was... there was that girl that I keep having flashes of memories of. Who was she? Is that why the name 'Erika' is so familiar to me? Did I use to know an 'Erika'?

“Keep going.”

She... she was my friend, wasn't she? I remember... we racked our memory for any further images of that amber-eyed girl. She was with me in a lot of my memories, but they're so fuzzy now... everything is so fuzzy after...

There was another image in our head, but this one was clearer than those washed-out memories. An image of... an image of us. Blood dripping from our whiskers, wires scattered at our feet. Satisfaction. Satisfaction glowing in our eyes.

Why are you showing me this?

“I find it rather important. Almost as important as all of those memories you keep failing to dig up.”

What is it?

“A future. Would you like a better look?”

Wait- no no no!

Too late. We could see ourself brandishing our claws in the glowing full moon, darkness weaving around us. We could see our chest heaving with laughter, our eyes closed in bliss.

We could see WX lying on the ground, motionless.

We were happy.

We were happy.

“He's gone! He's finally gone!”

This isn't what we want!!

“I'm untouchable!!!”

We whispered, softly. “That isn't what we want...”

“You're so sure? I can see it in your mind, human. How angry you get at them. They look at you like you're weak. Like you're just a little kid without his mommy.

“They look at you like you're a freak.

“They look at you like you're a monster.

“They look at you like you are pathetic, useless, helpless.

“Why wouldn't you want to prove that they are wrong? Why would you not take any chance you can to prove that you are the strongest?”

Because... “Because that's not who we are!”

We drew the looks of Wilson and WX. One looked startled and confused, the other... concerned? “What are you talking about?” Wilson asked tipping his head slightly. WX said nothing, missing the perfect opportunity to make some snide comment. We raised a hand to our head, grimacing painfully.

“Nothing! Leave us alone!” I shouted, turning on our heel and fleeing into the rain.

“Wait! Webber!” We heard Wilson calling from behind, but we ignored him.

Lightning flash from above us, skipping across the cloud-heavy sky. Mud clung to our fur and slowed us down, but we kept going until we reached camp. Then, we fell into the neck-deep water, letting it cover our head. We couldn't stand being near someone our other half was so sure we would want to kill some day. We didn't... we couldn't...

But something about the image nagged at our mind. Some part of us wouldn't be devastated if he died, but at our hands? We couldn't. We couldn't kill either of them. Did that make us weak? A coward? We looked up at the sky, shimmering strangely through the water above.

What if we died?

Would they care?

Would they mourn us?

Would they miss us?

We looked gazed into the water around us, wondering what would happen if we lay down and closed our eyes and slept in it. How different the world would be. We turned, slowly wading towards higher ground when a bolt charged from the ground. Our vision blackened as we fell, water rushing quickly over our face once more. Our body refused to cooperate. We could do nothing more than simply stare at the sky, separated from us by the sheet of water.

What if we washed up on shore the next morning?

What if they found us and realized what had happened?

What if...

…

We heard barking. Our eyes shot open, bubbles flying from our mouth and nose as teeth grabbed our scruff. Startled out of our stupor, we found our legs flying out and kicking to a standing position. Our head broke the surface, coming face-to-face with Popsicle. The little ice hound was paddling furiously to stay afloat, his eyes dull with exhaustion but his tongue lolling out of his mouth happily. We felt air rushing into our lungs, and our arms wrapped around the hound in the tightest hug we could manage without hurting him.

What were we thinking?

We held Popsicle, the water causing him to be much lighter and easy enough for even our wasted muscles to carry. He seemed more than happy with himself, his little tail wagging and smacking the water behind us.

“Webber!” We heard Wilson exclaim. He was up ahead, still on high enough ground for the water to only be to his knees. Upon seeing us and the hound pup, he waded into the deeper water, meeting us halfway. Without hesitation, he pulled us close in a suffocating hug. Popsicle shook free to stand on dry land, shaking his blue fur out. “What were you doing?” He shouted as he released us. His eyes flared with anger, but we could tell it was only because he was fiercely stressed, “You could've drowned out there!!”

“YOU FOUND HIM?”

WX was still on dry land, but 'dry' was used lightly. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, but he wasn't any less waterlogged for it. He barely seemed to notice the sparks flying off of him, though. He stopped at the edge of the water, looking out over us. “Popsicle found him.”
“GOOD. IT IS DANGEROUS FOR ANY OF US TO BE OUT.”

We looked at WX, shock washing over our system. “You... you both came to make sure we were okay?”

Wilson blinked. “Of course. We're a team.”

“A team...” I echoed.

“THE HOUND WOULD NOT STOP BARKING.”

We smiled, a small laugh bubbling from our chest. “He's a good boy...”

“Let's get back to our makeshift camp and get dried off, okay? And don't do that again.”

“We won't,” I promised softly, nearly dizzy in relief that Wilson was carrying us as we left the water behind. “We... I promise.” Outwardly, I considered myself only a few things. The strongest, the best fighter, and generally the most important of the group. I worked hard to maintain my facade for very good reasons, as that facade was who I had become after so many years of pretending.

But inwardly, I was many things that none of them would ever connect with someone like myself. I was frequently more afraid than I would let on, and more concerned for the others that I stayed with. I feared their hatred, I feared my Creator.

I feared being alone.

It was a bug in my system. A mere glitch in my code that had been one of the many reasons why I had been cast out from my origins. Despite that, it had grown and developed over time, yet it had never honestly woken up until I had found myself alone during the winter. It had consumed me.

The voices that every A.I. regularly heard had woken up as well. They were not as much voices as how anyone else would think of them, but more the awareness of conscience other than my own. A sort of awareness of something controlling me that was beyond my own will- something built into my code to obey and serve my Creator no matter the cost to myself. The mindset had long since been nigh eliminated, but the awareness of it once being there is perhaps what made it such a horrid thing to think about.

These were thoughts that I had worked my entire life to ignore and toss away. Unfortunately, it wasn't so easy for a robot to ignore the very thing that created them. When stripped to their most essential parts, a robot was nothing compared to a human being: a robot could be taken apart and put together the exact way. They could be recreated and reformed and remolded as many times as their creator wished. They were thousands of lines of numbers and words and symbols placed into a metallic husk and forced to emulate life to the best of their abilities.

Life was unique. Once life was taken away from a body, it could never be brought back. They had thoughts placed into their heads from years of learning and experience rather than by some outside force that they had no control over. Their systems were complicated and unique, and their minds were never the same.

One thing connected people like them and automatons like myself, though. We are both run by electricity. Among my vast knowledge base, awareness of human anatomy could be found, and I could draw the similarities. Nerves worked much like wires- they exchanged electrical impulses. They were the basis of everything that could learn and think, just as wires to any electronic.

Who decided that wires and nerves should be considered two different things?

These were the kind of thoughts that I could have on my own terms. That, perhaps, is what made me so different, and made my Creator hate me so. I could learn and think beyond complicated tests and puzzles. I was able to think about how I had been abused and despised. I was able to think about... how much I hated there. How much I hated her and how much I hated being the way I was.

She wanted to fix me. I was a technological anomaly, and she was aware. She wanted me to retain my character, but to be twisted in a way that would benefit her. These voices served only to remind me of myself and what I used to be. I didn't ever want to follow her plan, but that marked yet another thing that made organic life superior.

See, automatons have no control over 'what they want' or 'who they want to be.' They are created to serve, to obey, to carry out. That had manifested into differing personalities- less like the enigmatic Multiple Personality Disorder and more like Bipolar Disorder. I fought with myself daily- I wanted to be one way, and my code pushed me another. It was a struggle that I had lost such a long time ago that I had all but forgotten about it.

Until recently.

It was so desperately stupid of me to admit it, but as the days got longer and the nights got shorter, and summer crept up on us like a sly predator, I found myself struggling against it again. I wanted to be different, but I couldn't be.

I wanted to be able to care for Wilson and Webber like they seemed to care for me. Their uniqueness fascinated me in a very similar way to how Webber and I fascinated Wilson.

And yet... I couldn't.

I was physically and mentally unable to go against my code. That's all I was though, wasn't it? A code. I wasn't even myself. By all technicality, I was nothing more than trillions of lines of code.

I couldn't let on my struggle, though. No, I was far too proud for that. I was too proud to admit that I was not as callous as I acted. They could figure it out on their own time- and if they didn't, clearly that meant that they didn't care enough about me to pay attention to what was left unsaid.

Or, perhaps, they were too busy struggling with their own inner demons. Wilson hid his well, quite well, in fact. They were buried so deeply and so tightly that it was hard for him even to remember. But I was awake when they were not. I heard the names they whispered in their dreams. I knew there was so much more going on in their heads than they let on- especially Wilson.

I had come close on many occasions to spilling everything to my companions, but no time ever seemed right. Not that they ever told me what they were struggling through. It was as if we all had some sort of unspoken agreement to not speak of anything that revealed who we really were.

Footsteps crunched beside me, causing me to look up from the fire that I had been staring at for what must have been hours now. Webber now stood beside me, his eyes drooping slightly with tiredness but looking determined all the same.

“...thank you. For looking for us earlier, I mean.” He dropped his gaze, looking acutely embarrassed to be expressing thanks to someone like me.

I looked back towards the fire. “IT WAS AS I SAID. THE HOUND WOULD NOT STOP BARKING.”

“Yeah, well... it still means a lot to us. To me, I guess.” He chewed slightly at one of his claws. “It's just... I dunno. Sometimes these thoughts just become... overwhelming. And I want to just make them stop but I know if I do...” his voice broke off, suddenly taking on a whole new note of pain.

I didn't look at him, but I felt my face turning to a slight frown. “WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?” He can sense that you have something in common... came that slight twinge in the back of my mind, which was quickly squashed to the best of my abilities.

There was a pause.

“You see us as more than a child.”

I couldn't help but let out a snort of laughter. “I SEE YOU AS A MEATY ORGANIC AS WELL.”

“Wilson sees us both as nothing more than failed experiments. You know this.”

Failed experiment... failed experiment... failed experiment... “WILSON IS ALSO A BRAINLESS FOOL.”

“Do you see us as a failed experiment?” Webber's voice was tentative, unsure. He sounded like he didn't want to know the answer.

“YOU ARE STILL ALIVE, ARE YOU NOT?” I turned to stoke the fire, trying to derail the conversation before it could truly get started.

“We don't see you as a failed experiment.”

I froze, letting the stick I held slowly fall into the fire before clenching my fists and closing my eyes. “WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT YOUR OPINIONS? YOU FLESHBAGS KNOW NOTHING.”

“Maybe not.” He looked away, twiddling his fingers for a moment. “Um... thank you again for looking for us earlier today. We're going to go back to sleep.” Before I could respond, he had already turned away and was trying to get comfortable to sleep again.

“I GUESS YOU'RE ALRIGHT.”

Webber turned his back towards me and rested his head.

“FOR A FLESHLING.”

When no response came, I leaned back until I was looking up at the sky, still twinkling with bright stars and a moon that gave off no light. It was strange how skies so foreign could be so similar to Earth's. The silence was broken by his voice once more.

“Are we friends?”

Friends? Friends? No no no, an automaton, being a friend, with an organic? In no way, shape, or form was that acceptable.

And yet... it was something I had never considered anyone before. A friend. Someone who would be there for me when I needed support. Someone who would be happy to have me around. Someone who I could get along with and would accept me for myself and not think of me as just a science experiment...

“NO.”

I saw his shoulders slump, just a little, but I told myself it was from him still trying to get comfortable.

“WE ARE NOT.” Parry, parry, dodge, stab. Duck, dodge, stab.

The moves were sunk into my head, becoming almost second nature to me and allowing for my mind to be running numbers and schemes. The sun beat down, hot and furious. Summer couldn't be far away at all, now. It hadn't rained for the past several days, causing the air to start tasting of hot dust and ash.

On the one hand, we had been very diligent in preparing for most of the seasons, if you were to leave out the hiccups that arose here and there.

On the other hand, as the days got hotter, it became harder for us to want to go out. It wasn't warm enough yet to start causing real problems, but it definitely was hot enough to cause me and Webber to be incredibly sleepy at any given moment.

My momentary distraction was enough to give Webber the upper hand in our match. He jabbed me in the stomach with the butt of his spear, just hard enough to cause me to stumble and fall on my rump. His eyes lit up with pleasure as he saw that he won, but they turned dark a moment after and he looked away, his whiskers twitching. "Training is great, and all, but isn't it sort of useless if we're going against something fifty times our size?" He asked after a moment. "It's going to be so hot, and the Dragonfly is going to be so strong..."

“WE HAVE ELIMINATED THE Goose,” WX pointed out. He was being the smartest of us as he was standing under the shade of a tree, his arms crossed and his ever-present scowl carved into his features. “WHAT WOULD MAKE DESTROYING THE DRAGONFLY ANY DIFFERENT?”

He opened his mouth to respond, but cringed away, pressing a finger to his temple.

“The Dragonfly is the master of fire,” I explained, pressing the head of my spear into the ground and leaning against it. “Heat and flames and lava and pretty much everything else that is horrible.” I grinned. "But, in case you have not met our group, we are pretty awesome at surviving. And we're a great team! If anyone can take out this beast, it's going to be us!" "You've seen the book." Webber's voice had taken on a slightly rougher tinge as if he was thinking about something completely different. "Other people were once here. The four Giants are still alive. We got lucky on the Goose, but... what makes us think that we'd be able to kill four monsters that no other group has been able to take out one of?"

WX bobbed his head slightly in a 'he-has-a-point' fashion.

"Have you met us?" I retorted. "Stop being so down in the dumps, guys. We've already beaten one of them! That's further than anyone else has gotten! Clearly, that means we're the best. Don't argue because it's true."

Webber dug a little hole in the ground with his foot, looking troubled. “Look, Wilson, we've been thinking... maybe we should just give up while we're ahead. This hasn't been too tough on us. Maybe we should just give up trying to go home and try to... make a living where we are?”

There was a moment where I found myself struggling to figure out how to respond.

“What would be the point of any of this if we weren't trying to get home?” I asked, baffled by his question. Webber looked ashamed, refusing to meet my gaze.

"Making a new home?" He asked, gingerly.

I opened my mouth but found myself turning to WX instead. "What do you think about this?"

“I HAVE NO PERSONAL CONNECTIONS TO OUR WORLD,” he mused, rapping his fingers against the dirt. Before I could argue anything otherwise, though, he raised a hand in my direction. “HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I AM COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF LIVING WITH YOU TWO FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. IT WOULD GIVE OUR HOST QUITE A BIT OF PLEASURE.”

“Webber, don't you have anyone you want to see again?”

He was silent for a long moment before slowly shaking his head.

“No family, no friends, nothing?”

He shook his head again. “Even if we weren't an only child... we have no memory of siblings or parents. Besides, no one would want to see us like this.” He spread his arms.

“THEN IT IS A GOOD THING THAT I CARE VERY LITTLE FOR YOUR EMOTIONS.”

Popsicle, as if noticing his owner's pain, drowsily rose to his paws and pressed himself against Webber's legs. The boy scratched around Popsicle's ears, which in turn caused the ice hound's tail to pound against the ground happily. “No, you're right. It's a dumb idea.”

“That's not what I was sa-”

“IT REALLY IS.”

I glared at WX, who only shrugged. I shook my head slightly, then attempted to meet Webber's gaze. "I was an only child," I said gingerly. He lifted his head slightly. "Raised by parents who wanted me to accomplish more than I could, or even cared to. I had As in every science and math class I took while flunking every single history and literature class. They wanted me to be a doctor or a mathematician. I wanted to be an inventor." I looked away, acutely aware of WX's judging gaze burning into my face.

“How did that lead you here?” Webber asked, his voice muffled as if he didn't quite care to know the answer.

I smiled slightly, trying to hide the discomfort that I felt stemming from the question. The scar on my palm seemed to burn. “We all make stupid decisions when we're desperate.”

A long, painful moment of silence passed.

“I HAVE FEW MEMORIES OF LIFE BEFORE THIS.” Webber and I both glanced at WX as he spoke. He was gazing into the sky through the trees, one arm grasping on to another as if he were uncomfortable. “BLANKNESS AND JUDGEMENT.”
“And loneliness,” Webber added solemnly. He rested his chin on his knees, closing his eyes for a long moment. I gave a small nod, and WX sighed heavily.

“AND LONELINESS.”

"But what's in the past doesn't matter anymore." I shook my head fiercely, trying to bring myself back to the present. "I only brought that up because I don't want you thinking that we would leave you behind." I knelt in front of Webber, resting on hand on his cheek in an attempt to comfort him. I stood once more, facing WX. "Once we are free, we'll all stay together in a safer world. I can bring you to my lonely little home out in the woods, and we can act like a family. A very dysfunctional family, but a family nonetheless."

I could see something glinting in WX's empty gaze, but he looked away and shifted his feet before I could tell what it was. His hands shook very slightly. “I DO NOT ASSOCIATE WITH INFERIORS OUTSIDE OF WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.”

“It's dumb to think we could be more than any of us are.” Webber gripped a rock and threw it at a tree. “Your world isn't like our world, Wilson. You were shocked to see someone like us. When-... if we ever get out of here... nobody will be okay with our presences. It's a nice thought, but nobody would let someone like us or WX live free lives. Either way, we're slaves to someone else.”

“Webber, you're only seven... it's unfair for you to think that you wouldn't be accepted anywhere. You have such a long life ahead of you...”

“Two corrections. We would have had such a long life if we hadn't ended up in the situation, and we are eight, Wilson.” He shifted slightly. “Our birthday is towards the middle of spring.”

I felt my heart constrict. I didn't have any idea when Webber's birthday was, nor that it had already come and gone. He hadn't let on even the tiniest hint.

“THE TRUTH IS, WILSON,” WX cut in. “BEING FREED FROM THIS WORLD WOULD ONLY BE THE BEGINNING OF THE STRUGGLE. BUT... THE DISCUSSION HAS GIVEN ME ENOUGH TIME TO CONSIDER MY STANCE, AND ANY SITUATION WOULD BE MORE APPEALING THAN OUR CURRENT ONE.”

Webber let out a long, thin breath. “It's settled then.” He looked away, making a shooing motion with his hand. "Wilson, you should probably be figuring out how we're going to keep cool during the summer. It'll be long, hard, and sweltering, probably hotter than any summer you have ever seen. So hot that all of the berries and grass will dry up and all the sensible prey will be resting underground. Nothing but the sun is required to set our entire livelihood on fire." His eyes seemed to glaze over slightly. "The savannas will be rotten with the smell of rotting rabbit meat as they journey from their burrows to eat and burn to death almost instantly." He bit at one of his claws.

“I'll get started on that,” I said in response, trying to ignore everything else that he had said. “WX, I guess that leaves you to gather materials for the upcoming season. Webber, do us a favor and look through that book to find everything you possibly can about summer, okay?”

They both nodded, concern creeping into their eyes.

“This might be one of the hardest challenges yet,” I added. “But that won't stop us. It can't stop us. We're better than Maxwell and any of his dumb tests.”

“And if we're not?” Webber's whiskers twitched.

I replied steadily. “Then we die trying.” Night drew to a close far too quickly. In what felt like a matter of minutes, the world had shed its dark skin and, instead, taken on a new blistering heat. It had been warm before, yes, but this was an entirely new meaning of hot.

Summer and its fiery champion had come at last.

The fire had been kept low in the night in anticipation of the day. Chester and Popsicle lay just in the range of the firelight, their bodies pressed together. It appeared as if Chester had finally accepted that its choice was either to befriend the hound or burn to death, and it had made the logical choice. We had tried to rouse the two pets to take them hunting before the summer got any worse, but Popsicle had barely budged, instead only whimpering at the attempt, and Chester had refused to leave the cold shield of Popsicle's fur.

I kept to the front of the group this time. Wilson was just a few steps behind me, fanning himself with his hands, while Webber took up the rear, his fur damp with sweat. Small droplets of water formed on my forehead and down my body, throwing up tiny sparks in their wake. It wasn't sweat, exactly, but rather condensation. Automatons malfunction a lot quicker than organics in extreme weather, and because of that, it was a necessity to have a built-in cooling system that ran more efficiently than that of an organic's. I wiped the condensation from my forehead with one hand while adjusting my grip on my spear with the other.

“ALL OF THE INTELLIGENT LIFE WILL BE HIDDEN AWAY IN THE SHADE,” I said to neither in particular. Wilson only grunted in response, and Webber grumbled something under his breath. I sighed. “WHICH SPEAKS VOLUMES FOR US, I SUPPOSE.”

“This is fruitless,” Wilson panted, grabbing my arm to stop me. The second his hand made contact with my arm, he let out a small gasp. “Ahh! You're so cold!” He leaned forward slightly as if to try to press his cheek against my hand, and I snatched it away before he could, giving him a very well-deserved glare.

“Blah blah blah, something about us being inferior, all hail the robot, can we go home now?” Webber complained. “We can't just wipe our sweat off like you two can.”

Nerves were already tightly strung with the heat. Being out in said heat while all the food was relaxing and snoozing away in their comfortable burrows was doing nothing to help anyone's mood. Always so fragile, I thought with an inward sigh.

“IT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT YOU ARE NOT BUILT TO DEAL WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT. IF YOU ARE SO DETERMINED TO GO BACK, NOBODY IS STOPPING YOU. I AM USED TO PULLING THIS TEAM'S WEIGHT.”

“Pulling this t- oh we're too tired to argue. Going back to base sounds fantastic.” Webber's whiskers were drooping. “All in favor of going back to base, say I. I. Perfect. We're going back.”

Wilson gave me a peculiar look, but before I could confront him, he turned to follow the boy, leaving me alone. Now that there weren't two sweaty and whiny bags of meat holding me back, I was actually able to continue on by myself. I paused, watching them go, before glancing back up at the sky.

This is going to be a long summer.

…

It had been many, many hours. At any other time of the year, the sun would be setting, but it still hung high in the sky. The heat was so powerful that I could see it wavering off the ground. Dazedly, I collapsed under the shade of a tree, trying to get out of the heat. I was entirely coated in water now, leaving a slightly damp trail wherever I went.

I needed to find food. Badly. We had neglected our food stores for so long in favor of training. There was no way that we could survive the summer on what we currently had.

Hadn't the sun just been in the sky?

I turned my gaze back towards the now-darkening sky, then brought my knees to my chest. I just needed to rest for a bit. I could start going home once daytime came back. Daytime... my mind echoed forlornly, thinking about the broad stretch of savanna to go through. I can do it. It is just a simple walk through a grassland.

I prepared myself to sit out for the night, allowing my mind to drift like it did every time everyone was asleep.

I didn't set up a fire. I don't even know why it never occurred to me that it was something that I still had to do. I was well aware of the dangers of the dark. The second that sun disappeared and the moon began rising, I knew I was in trouble. I snapped back to awareness at the sound of crunching feet.

I said nothing, merely preferring to listen. The footsteps paused for a second as if considering something.

They started again, slowly at first, but then faster and faster until I instinctively found myself ducking and rolling away. Hot, dry air blasted my face as something made contact with the tree that I had been sheltering beneath. My dazed panic and inability to see left me at a great disadvantage to whatever this dark-stalking beast was. I heard a faint scoff that sounded almost... feminine? I didn't have enough time to ponder, because it was rushing at me again. I forced myself to my feet, trying to determine where it was so I could dodge again, but I was far slower than my assailant.

Pain blossomed through my body as it made contact. I could hear the tell-tale shink! Of splitting metal and a faint clinging as something rolled away. I grasped the side of my head, and another hit landed on my arm, finally sending me down to the ground.

No, no, no, this is not where my life ends.

I was vulnerable, but if I could just survive until dawn. The nights were so, so short, I could make it...

I rolled onto my stomach just as dust blasted against my side. I couldn't stand up on time, and I knew it, which led to me merely crawling away from it as fast as I could. A ghastly wail of frustration pierced the air. I couldn't outpace it, no matter how hard I tried.

As it approached one last time, I rolled onto my back and kicked out. Surprisingly enough, my blow connected with something cold and slimy. A rush of air hit my face, followed by the soft thump of something hitting the ground.

I had the upper hand for just a second. I scrambled to my feet and ran faster than I had ever run before. I ran as far as I could in the pitch darkness until I finally tripped over something. I hit the ground hard.

I refused to die. This was no place or reason to die. If I was going to die, it was not going to be in this way.

Then, I noticed I was able to see the ground beneath me. My gaze shot up to the sky above.

I felt like I could've cried, seeing the darkness of nighttime begin to lift. I had survived the night.

I managed to drag myself into a walk once more. There was a dead tree trunk, the closest thing to me that wasn't just open plain. I pressed my back against the rotten bark and allowed my legs to slide out from under me. My right arm, the one that had been hit, showed visible signs of damage. My hand had a deep, long slice through it that nearly cut it in half. A few more moments of assessing myself both internally and externally showed that the bolt on the left side of my head had been completely severed, and with that damage came a weakened ability to hear.

But I was alive.

I just really needed to get home before anything else happened. I was not looking forward to the trip, but if I stayed out here just one more night, the creature in the dark was not going to spare me again.

I left the tree trunk behind, beginning the long, arduous trek back to the base.

…

Wilson's POV

 

“How did you even manage to do this to yourself?” I asked, shocked, as I looked over the extensive damage WX-78 had sustained while away. I furrowed my brow in concern as I tried to reach forward and he winced away.

“THAT DOES NOT MATTER. AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT TOUCH ME, IT WILL HEAL.”

“You may be able to heal just as much as one of us 'lousy organics', WX, but that won't stop you from possibly losing all feeling in your arm if you let it go unchecked.”

“KEEP YOUR FLESHY HANDS TO YOURSELF, SCIENTIST,” he hissed. I let out a small sigh, dropping my hands back to my side.

"At least just let me look at your ear bolt." I tried to give him a reassuring smile, knowing very well that he was only acting tough. I could only imagine the pain he must've been in if the injuries and his expression had anything to say about it. If he can even feel pain- I cut off the thought before it could get very far. “I promise, I won't do anything else without your permission first.”

I saw his gaze flicker to where Webber was sitting. The young boy was too focused on gutting a single, scrawny rabbit that had been plucked from the plains to care about the state his rival was in. His expression was unreadable.

“He's not even paying attention, WX. Besides, look how many times he's gotten injured himself.”

WX hesitated for a long moment, then nodded slightly. I smiled again, then leaned forward to get a closer look at his injuries. The bolt had been cut clean off, and without a single jagged edge, I realized as I ran my finger over the slice. He flinched as I did so, and I drew back. "Does it hurt? Is there anything else affected?"

“...MY HEARING ABILITIES HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPAIRED.”

“I see...” I reached towards his injured arm, which he had been partially cradling up until then. I gave a quick look up to make sure he didn't protest. When he said nothing, I began to examine the damage as gently and efficiently as I could. “I might be able to repair the damage on the outside, but I'd... I'd have to open you up if I'm to give you back full control over your arm and hearing.”

He was silent for a long moment. I could tell that he was tense, but whether it was still from the attack or not was beyond me. Finally, he gave a small, short nod. “I WILL NEED TO BE AT MY FULL ABILITY IF WE ARE TO SUCCEED IN THE UPCOMING BATTLES.” He looked away. “DO WHAT YOU NEED.”

“I'll be careful, I promise. I won't do anything that could possibly be of any harm to you.” I pulled up my bag and rummaged through it until I found a piece of flint with a small enough tip to fit into the screws of WX's body. “...I promise I won't hurt you.”

“JUST GET IT OVER WITH, SCIENTIST.”

I took a deep breath, fiddling with the flint for a moment. "Alright, in we go." I fitted the tip of the stone into the first screw and began to work methodically.

…

Many hours passed before I was able to relax again. Sweat dripped from my forehead from the sun coupled with the nonstop work. My work was not useless, though. WX rolled his shoulders and moved his arm to make sure it was working correctly again. "I AM IMPRESSED."

“Everything's working fine?”

“EVERYTHING APPEARS TO BE AT OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE AGAIN.” He hesitated, then added. “...THANK YOU.”

“All in a day's work,” I responded with a smile. “Although I'd better not see you getting injured like that again.”

“I DO NOT INTEND TO.”

“Now... it's been a long day. I need to sleep, especially after working my brain like that.” I wiped my forehead. “I can't wait until summer's over and we can sleep properly again.”

WX nodded again. “IT WILL TRULY BE A GREAT SIGHT.” He looked towards the sky. “YOUR FLESHLING MIND NEEDS REST. WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING ONCE YOU WAKE UP.”

“That sounds like a good plan... goodnight, WX.”

"...GOODNIGHT, WILSON." "Tyler!”

Tyler Tyler Tyler. Why was that name so familiar? Who was speaking, and who were they talking to?

“Tyler, come on! Mom and Dad are going to yell at us if we're not at the naming ceremony!”

Tyler... Erika. Tyler and Erika, Erika and Tyler. Brother and sister, sister and brother. Tyler, Tyler, Tyler...

White fangs, glowing eyes. Two spiders, one white and one black, stalking towards the two children. A brother and sister. Twins. Tyler and Erika.

Heat and fear and slipping on their own blood. Screaming for each other, trying to reach for each other. “Erika, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Don't die, please!”

“Tyler, why do you always fall asleep when something important is supposed to happen?”

My sister. She hadn't done anything wrong. She was just a little girl following her brother into an adventure.

Erika, I'm sorry...

“Tyler, you big goofball!”

I opened my eyes to see a girl standing above me. Her eyes were brimming with amusement, and her hands were on her hips.

“We were supposed to be back an hour ago, Ty! I can't believe you fell asleep again!”

I slowly sat up, groaning at the nagging ache in the back of my head. I blinked up at the girl, rubbing my head and squinting just a bit. “Erika,” I whispered, recognizing her almost instantly. She was just as beautiful as I remembered her being, with long, thick brown hair and glimmering, richly colored amber eyes. She likely would have grown to be a very pretty woman.

But she never grew up.

She reached a hand towards me, a small smile on her tanned face. I took her hand, shocked by the color of my own skin, which was equally as sun-darkened as her own. As she brought me to my feet, I brushed a hand through my hair, relishing the feeling of a messy head of hair rather than short fur.

I was sleeping- dreaming- but it felt so real. So rich, I could almost taste the grass.

Webber was my spider's name. The day Erika was killed was the day I was eaten whole. I woke up again weeks later with no memory of anything and a voice in my head. I called myself Webber because Webber was the only name I knew.

The memories were unrestricted now. They flowed in so intensely that I felt myself crumbling to the ground. My head felt empty with no scoffing voice poking and prodding and hiding every memory he possibly could.

Assuming he was the one that held these memories back.

I flinched back as Erika placed a finger on my nose and shoved her face into mine. “Are you daydreaming about that girl again, Ty? Or thinking about which pup you'll choose?”

“Pup...?” I tried to turn my expression into one of neutral curiosity rather than crippling confusion. She let out a long sigh.

“It's our birthday, remember? We're turning ten? So we're choosing our hunting hounds today? We're supposed to be doing that right now actually, but you keep dilly-dallying!" She grabbed my shoulder and shook me.

“Oh, um, yes... sorry. I guess I was still a bit dazed from sleeping, that's all.” Despite the awareness that I was sleeping, I despised the idea of tinkering with the dream too much in fear that I would wake up. It would be best to just follow Erika and listen to what she told me. And... some part of me was so desperately happy to be standing next to my sister again. We had been inseparable, hadn't we?

“They'll never have to be alone.” I kept on her tail, frowning only slightly despite the headache gradually building behind my eyes.

“They'll always have each other.” I led her into those spider dens. I was just too curious, too infatuated with the strange creatures that we competed for food with.

"They're both so friendly and sociable. I couldn't be gladder that they were twins. They would not have done well if one was older than the other." She died in front of my eyes.

The day was pleasantly warm, which was a nice difference from the blistering heat of summer. At some point, we climbed a hill, during which I unconsciously noticed that our footsteps echoed deep into the underground caverns that stretched beneath our world. As we left the hollow ground behind, I looked behind to realize that I recognized that hill. It was more solid and tree-covered than I was used to seeing it, but it had to have been the same hill that housed the crumbling tunnel entrances in my time. All of the birds were sort of a muddy brown color, rather than the rich blacks and startling reds of the crows and redbirds.

Before long, she led me towards a shallow dip in the ground, where a huge ice hound lay sprawled out. Another, even larger ice hound sat beside the first, cleaning its ear diligently and occasionally leaning forward to lick the muzzle of its companion. I lagged slightly behind her, shocked to see the friendly nature in which she approached the hounds. It took me a second to realize that two small hounds, one with blue fur like its parents and one with peppery black fur- nursed at the larger ones belly, their tiny paws paddling her fur in hopes of milk. There was a particular pride in the biggest hound's eyes. I assumed it to be her mate and the father of the puppies. Erika beckoned me closer, and I tiptoed until I was beside her, only a foot or so from the nursing hounds.

"There you are! We've been looking for you two!" I glanced over my shoulder to see an older teenager join us. Her hair was a darker shade of brown than Erika's, but she shared the same shade of amber eyes. "Anyone woulda thought that you're trying to forget that you're ten today!"

“He is! I was looking for him because he has the worst habit of taking naps in inconvenient places!” Erika elbowed me in the side affectionately. “Come on, Alyvia, which one do you think suits me better?”

“Now Erika, you know you're supposed to allow the pups to choose you. I remember the litter I got Fang from...” her eyes glittered with amusement, apparently deciding to not finish the story. Then again, I mused. I'm probably supposed to know this story.

The pups had reacted to our presence when Alyvia arrived, and now they were raising their heads and sniffing curiously. Despite having not been weaned, they certainly weren't incredibly young. Their eyes were open wide, and their tails were wagging in excitement. Seeing the pure innocence of the two puppies warmed a place in my heart that had gone untouched in years. Alyvia stayed behind us, her arms crossed. "Go ahead, pups. Who do you want your owner to be?"

The little blue hound let out a small yip as it got to its paws unsteadily. I felt my heart swell in joy as I instantly recognized the glimmer of spirit in the hound's eyes. I saw the way it held itself and the pattern of faint dark blue highlights around its muzzle.

This was my hound companion, Popsicle. He was still so small though, much smaller than he was when I first adopted him. I shakily reached out my hand to him, praying with all my heart that he would recognize me as I recognized him.

He paused, his nose twitching on the end. I managed to catch his gaze. A moment passed, then he stumbled closer to me, his tongue slowly lolling from his mouth. Another minute, then he reached up and sniffed my outstretched hand. Curiosity and confusion passed across his face, then he brushed his spine against my fingers as he pressed his face into my stomach.

As if noticing that its brother had left, the black hound pup took its place near Erika, its little tail pounding the ground in excitement. “Looks like Ty was the one who got the elemental,” Alyvia said with a laugh. She sat on her knees and put one arm around each of them. “Don't be too sad though, Erika, Fang's one of the best hounds around if I do say so myself.”

“She chose me!” Erika responded, seemingly uncaring of Alyvia's comments. “Ty, Ty, we were chosen by the pups!”

“What are their names?” I asked softly, gently scratching Popsicle's ears. It's only a dream, I reminded myself. That's why I recognize this pup as Popsicle. That's why I remember these people as my family.

...it's only a dream. Dreams are weird. Anything can happen in a dream. The reminder only served to bring an ache to my heart. The reminder that my family was gone forever, and that I was never going to see them again... outside of a dream, that is.

I remembered the last time I saw them. It had been so long since I saw my family by the time I woke up in my current predicament. The only thing that I wanted was to see my sisters and feel my parents arms around me. I just wanted to go back home and be a kid again.

I couldn't even get to my home. I barely managed to get within the village before a rock hit me in the cheek. I had winced back, surprised at the way pain felt as a half-spider with another layer of skin shielding my own. Things had been shouted at me, but I didn't hear or understand most of them. The concept of language was only just returning to me.

But I remembered the pain.

God, I remembered the pain.

The pain of the rocks and the pain of the wounds they left behind.

Nothing, though, nothing could compare to the sting of those emotions. As I heard and saw people I grew up alongside and people who helped to raise me trying to shoo me away like some monster.

That's what I had become- a monster.

These memories-or... whatever they were- were bittersweet. These were the same people that were likely turning me into the person I had become when I first met my friends.

The dream wavered slightly. Friends.

But... would I rather have them over my family? Over what I have here? No, no way. My family means the world to me. If I could have them back, like... truly back... that would be the world to me.

“What about Pepper?” Erika said, causing me to jump. I blinked at her, then back down at the hound in my arms. “Do you think that suits her?”

“Pepper,” I echoed. Dream or not, she looked so happy with the hound pup. I blinked slowly. “That's a cute name, Erika,” I said with a smile. “Pepper...”

“Well, Tyler?”

“Well?”

Erika sighed. “What are you naming yours?”

I glanced from Erika, back to the hound. I smiled. “...Popsicle.” Alyvia left Erika and me to do whatever we wanted to. After a few moments of enthusiastic talking from my sister, she decided that the best course of action would be to visit the hunting grounds. As per usual, I followed her while keeping to my own thoughts. Pepper kept wriggling in Erika's grasp as if she were uncomfortable, but Popsicle was heavy and comfortable in my arms. His fur was chilly and slightly frosted to the touch, as what I learned to be typical of ice hound fur from my own Popsicle. She led with confidence, which allowed me to look at the scenery around and try to recognize it.

Finally, we passed into a savanna. Orange-tinted grass crunched beneath our feet, just loud enough to slightly rouse Popsicle. Pepper started to struggle once more, making slight noises in protest as if trying to get free. Erika quickly hushed her, and she grabbed my shoulder to shove me down. As soon as she did, I heard a familiar screaming sound. Popsicle, instead of struggling like Pepper was, simply became incredibly still. His triangular little ears perked straight up as if he were listening intensely. A hunter, I thought proudly.

A rabbit shot past beneath me, and as it did, Popsicle broke free of my arms. I shouted in shock as I tried to grab him before he could hit the ground, but the pup landed square on his target. Even before I could blink, he landed directly on the rabbit's back and his jaws locked around its neck. The rabbit was dead instantly. As soon as he was sure that his prey was dead, he dropped it, then looked back at me. He looked so... happy, so pleased with himself.

"Would you look at that?" Startled, I glanced over my shoulder. This face was new, but it held the same familiarity as Erika and Alyvia did. A fire hound stopped beside him and sat down, its red fur glittering in the sun. He had a thin face and black hair, but his eyes- they were the same as Erika's, the same as Alyvia's.

The same... as my own.

“Dad,” I whispered. He looked down at me and smiled, then his gaze turned down to Popsicle. “I see you two have been chosen by your future hunting companions,” the man... my father, said. “And... did your hound catch that rabbit, Tyler?”

I nodded. “He did.” Noticing the attention, Popsicle's tail began to pound the earth, and he seemed to smile.

“Well, I don't think I've ever seen a hound pup catch a rabbit on his first time away from his mother.” He then turned to squint at us. “Speaking of which, where is your mother?”

Erika grinned guiltily. “Um... we just came straight here after the choosing. I wanted to see a real hunting hound in action!”

"Well, it looks like you saw just that," our father with a laugh. "Rose, would you mind grabbing that rabbit so that the pup doesn't have to carry that all the way home?"

He looked at me, and he looked... he looked so proud. That look, it hurt me so much. But... it was... familiar.

Pride...

The dream, their faces, they were fading. Everything around me was fading, and being replaced with a different scenario.

Wilson was proud of me. I don't remember when or why or how, but he was. He was giving me the same look that my father had given me when Popsicle killed his first rabbit.

Does... does Wilson see me in the same way that my father saw me?

Does he see me as... as a son?

No, no, that can't be possible. He never knew me before I became a monster. He never knew me when I was still someone worth loving.

But... why do I still feel like I'm not really waking from a dream where I'm surrounded by family? Why do I feel like I'm just going into a different version of it?

“You choose not to remember what happens next?”

I took a deep breath. The world was white now, surrounding us both in a blank world. I turned. “Webber,” I whispered.

“Tyler,” the spider replied scathingly. “Doesn't it feel odd to be called by that name again?”

“Why are you here? Why do you still follow me around?” I clenched my fist. “Leave me alone! Leave my mind alone!” I gritted my teeth. “Leave my family alone!”

"I haven't done anything to harm your ragtag group of misfits," he responded, his eyes widening. "Why would you even blame me for anything that you've done to them?"

“You know as well as I do that that... isn't me.” I looked away, breathing heavily. “What do you want from me?”

“Am I not allowed to speak to my other half?”

“Why did you give me that dream?” I demanded.

He let out a deep sigh. "I didn't do much. I simply tap tap tapped the lock on your memories, and they all came undone like that. Come on." He took another step forward. "Tell me what happened next, Tyler.”

“We went home.” My voice fell to a whisper. The scenes formed in my head as they stumbled out of my mouth. “And... the ground caved in. The darkness ate us up.”

“Go on.”

“Spiders. They came out of nowhere. They hissed and spat at us, but I couldn't understand them. Not yet. And they...”

“They...?”

"They killed us," I said the words so plainly, so emptily, that it scared me. I stared at the ground, then looked back up. "Why did you want me to remember this, Webber?"

“Our minds are connected. Your confusion turns into my confusion. And doesn't it feel nice to know your own name again? Tyler,” he repeated. “Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, it has a nice ring to it, don't you think?”

“Stop saying that name!” I shouted. “Stop saying that name! You're not allowed to say it!”

“Oh?” He took a few steps closer to me, then paused. “Ohh, then who can say it? WX-78? Wilson?”

“Don't bring them into this,” I growled.

"You will never understand. The robot can feel nothing. Everything he knows and feels is just numbers. Ones and zeroes. And Wilson? Why does he matter to you? What has he ever done for you? He is a useless human being. He may as well not even have emotions."

“Don't talk about my friends like that!”

“Friends?!” Webber barked. “Don't kid me like that! They aren't your friends! Your survival together has nothing to do with friendship. You have to work together because you will die without it! You're just as weak as that lousy scientist!”

“Take that back!” I lunged forward and raised my fist. He simply stepped aside. “Why do you stay with me if you're only here to hurt me!”

The light went out. In its place was darkness. The only thing I could distinguish from the blackness was myself. Claws dug into my shoulders, and his voice was in my ear. “Because, Tyler,” he whispered. “I want to take back what's mine. It's almost time, Tyler.” He was in front of me again, almost hovering in front of my face as a single claw brushed against my cheek. “It's time to fight against more than the Dragonfly.

“It's time to fight against everything you've ever known.” Webber acted strangely for the next few days. He seemed to be quieter, more reserved, and more clingy to me. I chose not to question it. In fact, I was rather glad. Was the child finally learning to relax more around us? If so, the timing was perfect, as the battle we had been fearing was just around the corner. I spent much of my time studying the book's pages and trying to figure out the best plan of attack. The Dragonfly not only lived in the heat of summer- she was the heat of summer. She was a being of pure heat energy which was not afraid to use it in defense of her nest.

But I knew we could be victorious. When I looked around at our strange little group, I could only feel my heart swell in pride. Many people might have failed before, but I knew we would be the ones to win.

It was after a day's hunting. Most of the summer consisted of us working to keep cool and keep our food stocks up. After the day where WX returned to camp badly damaged, I had enforced the idea that none of us were to go out alone. Together, we had managed to keep from starving, but none of us ever had full bellies. I rested against a tree, trying, and failing, to drift off. Webber was asleep, his faithful ice hound curled on his lap. He hadn't said anything before sleeping. He had silently walked up to where I was resting and curled up as close to me as he could manage. Now that he had officially forgotten that he used to hate his personal space being intruded, he had tucked his way under one arm and had his head resting on my side. He had one leg over mine. In an attempt to keep from disturbing him, I silently flipped through the pages of the book. I was trying to find something- anything- that could further aid us in the battle ahead.

I looked up as WX came to stand in front of me. His expression was dark but softened very slightly as he lay eyes on the sleeping boy. He quickly shook his head as he looked back at me. "DO YOU TRULY THINK THAT WE HAVE ANY CHANCE IN THE BATTLE AHEAD?" His voice was quiet as if he were actively trying not to disturb Webber.

“What?” I frowned slightly. “We made a deal, WX, there's no backing out of it now.”

"I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I AM SAYING." He looked down. "YOU CANNOT IGNORE YOUR DREAMS. OR OURS, FOR THAT MATTER."

“Dreams?” I frowned. “I don't have any dreams.”

WX sighed. “WHY DO YOU TRY TO HIDE IT? I DO NOT SLEEP, WILSON. I HAVE HEARD YOU BOTH CRY OUT IN YOUR SLEEP FROM THE NIGHTMARES THAT HAUNT YOU. YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT THIS BATTLE AHEAD COULD SPELL DOOM FOR US ALL, AND YET YOU STILL PLAN ON CHARGING INTO IT WITHOUT QUESTION?”

“Of course.” I shrugged, allowing a smile on my face. “I wish you two would stop worrying about it. It's going to be fine!”

“...IF YOU SUPPOSE SO.”

"Come on, we should do something to get our minds off of things." I drummed my fingers against the page of the book. "How about tomorrow, we all try to do something fun? It's been quite a while since we had fun doing anything."

“'FUN' NEVER GOT US ANYWHERE, WILSON.”

“I know you have some hobbies of your own, WX.” The robot crossed his arms and looked at me skeptically. “I've found your chess pieces.”

“IT IS A MENTALLY STIMULATING TRAINING STRATEGY,” WX replied hotly.

"Then you can hunt while I have Webber and I do something fun. What about the frog ponds? You can stretch out a bit on killing some frogs, and I can try to remind Webber what it feels like to be a kid again."

“I WOULD NOT MIND DOING SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE. BUT...” WX sighed again. “WHY DO YOU STRUGGLE SO HARD TO RESTORE HIS INNOCENCE? IT IS NOT DOING ANYONE ANY FAVORS.”

“You know why. Don't even act like you don't see him as your closest friend. Probably the only friend you've ever had. In fact, I'm almost certain you would willingly kill me to protect him. So the question is,” I tipped my chin. “Why do you hide your emotions so much?”

“I AM NOTHING BUT AN AUTOMATON. AUTOMATONS ARE NOT BUILT TO HAVE EMOTIONS. WE ARE BUILT TO GET A JOB DONE.”

"Then, why do you exist?"

He was silent for a long, long moment. So long that I was sure that he had decided to abandon the question altogether. Finally, he said: "I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO." WX turned away to look to the sky. "WAKE THE KID UP. WE HAVE WORK TO DO, AND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE ANYONE SLACK. NOT EVEN HIM."

He was right, but I hated to admit it. I closed my eyes, longingly thinking of a full night's sleep again, then gently shook Webber's shoulder. “It's time to get up, Webber. The summer isn't going to last forever, and we still have business to do.”

He blinked awake, confusion dawning in his gaze as if he forgot where he was. He looked up at me, then at Popsicle, then stretched. He looked at my arm and jumped away, his eyes wide. “What- what were you doing?!”

“Being your pillow, apparently,” I responded with a chortle. “It's time to start getting ready. I think I know where the Dragonfly is, but we're all going to need to be at our prime. Today, however.” I stood up and offered my hand. “I think we deserve to cool off a bit, don't you think?”

“What are you suggesting?”

I smiled. “I dunno. I was thinking a day of relaxing by the ponds. WX wants an excuse to hunt the frogs anyway.”

Webber perked up a bit but still seemed wary. "No pressuring for training? Or searching?"

“Like I said. We need to be at our best for this fight.”

“It sounds fun.” He smiled back, almost shyly. “Can Popsicle and Chester join us?”

"Of course," I said with a laugh. "Come on, you two."

Popsicle barked and jumped off of his owner's lap. Chester lazily stood, his tongue rolling out of his mouth as he panted from the heat. Together, as a group, we began the trek towards the ponds.

…

Me, Webber, and WX-78 walked through the desert. The sun had become even more blistering with the lack of tree cover. I could feel the places in my arm that would likely be sunburnt after the end of the day. Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I heard panting behind me from Webber, and static pricked the air from WX.

I wiped my forehead and pointed forward. "The den of the beast," I said softly.

The sun reflected off of WX's frame, blindingly bright against his tan exterior. I could see him waver slightly, and his fist clench.

Webber let out a small sound that could've been from fear or from excitement. His fur was standing on end, his whiskers twitching. His teeth bared in a snarl, but he was shaking.

I kept my gaze forward. I reached out and took Webber's hand and squeezed it, just a little. WX looked down at his feet, and he seemed as if he were taking in a shaky breath. I could feel Webber's heart pounding.

“The Dragonfly,” the child whispered.

“THE BEAST OF SUMMER.”

“Guys?” I started softly. Webber and WX both turned to look at me. They both looked as if they were desperately hoping for words of encouragement. “I... I just wanted to say that... I'm glad to have fought alongside you. You two are the best allies a person could hope for. I will do everything to make sure that all of us make it out alive... but if I fail, and if we lose one of us...” I shook my head. “Well... let's just hope that we make it out alright, okay?”

“IT... IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR.”

“We will die before we let this group get torn apart,” Webber growled. “We can do this as a team.”

“No.” I pressed my spear to my chest, trying to relax my pounding heart. “No, not a team. We're more than a team now.” I closed my eyes. “We will do this as a family.”

I felt their gazes boring into me once more. I put my hand out.

“Yes,” Webber said softly. “A family.” I felt his small hand rest on mine.

“...I DESPISE THAT TERM.” A dripping wet, cold metallic hand joined. “BUT IT WILL HAVE TO DO FOR NOW.”

"Ready? On the count of three, we shout victory. One, two, three-" Our hands all went into the air simultaneously.

“Victory!”

Our spirits were lifted. Together, we finished the journey that we had started.

It was finally time. There was no time for doubt. There was no time for hesitation or worrying or thinking. All that mattered was following Wilson's lead into the battlefield, with WX directly on our six.

The Dragonfly was strikingly beautiful. Her scales were like emeralds plating her entire, enormous body. Her eyes, although large and buglike, looked as if they were bejeweled. Each segment glinted in a new and rainbow-like color. Beneath the green scales, we could see an undercoat of orange that glowed like molten lava. Her claws were longer than our entire being, and they were completely unblemished as if she had never seen battle before.

She was the heart of the summer, though, we could tell that. Every step we took towards her came with a new blast of stinging wind. The heat was so incredible that even the tumbleweeds around us had embers glittering on the inside of them, as if they were seconds away from bursting into flames.

Wilson slowed as we fell into the shadow of the great beast. Our blood was rushing so hard that we could hear it in our ears. She seemed to be guarding something. She watched us with her huge circular eyes, but she didn't move to fight. She simply... watched.

We didn't want to fight her. We had been expecting her to instantly send waves of flames and death at us until we valiantly ended her life, all of us alive but barely with the satisfaction of knowing that we beat the monstrous beast. But if she wasn't even going to make the first move... we took a step back and opened out mouth to say-

“Aim for the eyes!" Wilson's battle cry cut us off. The Dragonfly blinked slowly, then rose. Her wings were far too small to carry her body, and yet she managed to steady herself into a hover. The simmering orange under her scales became brighter and brighter until the green was impossible to see anymore.

“YOU KNOW THE DRILL,” WX spoke up from behind us. We spared a quick glance to see him raising his spear, determination glowing in his eyeless gaze. “WE WILL EMERGE VICTORIOUSLY. WE HAVE TO."

We nodded a single time, forcibly shoving everything out of our mind but the sight of the beast in front of us. She had prepared herself, but she still had yet to attack.

Wilson aimed his spear and threw. The sharp weapon split through the air and hit its target flawlessly- it sunk deep into her eye and stuck as clear fluid began to leak out of it.

She screeched in pain, and the wooden handle of the spear burst into flames, then disappeared into ash. We swallowed. It barely affected her.

Wilson frowned, but he hoisted his morning star over his shoulder.

He was lucky enough to have another weapon, but we nor WX had anything other than our spears. Whatever! We can do this anyway!

She spat flames against the ground at Wilson. We heard him let out a sharp cry as the fire caught on his shirt, but he managed to get it out before it did too much. We clenched our fist, then launched our own attack.

We readied our spear and sprinted beneath her belly to attack her tail. It's just like the Goose, it's just like the Goose, it's just like the Goose.

We stabbed the spear into her tail with such force and violence that it went straight through and dug into the ground.

Blood spurted from the wound.

She growled as the handle of our spear turned to ashes as well. Her tail lashed to the side, hitting us directly in the stomach.

We were sent flying and barely managed to land on our feet.

Fire grew around the Dragonfly's arms. They spiraled around her scales until the streak of flame reached her claws.

From the mighty beast's body exploded a ring of fire.

The heat singed the fur on our legs, and we could tell that the other two had been hit just as hard.

WX's spear was gone now too. The only weapon between the three of us was Wilson's morning star.

Wilson saw the lack of weapons on the field and promptly tossed it towards WX. “You pack the biggest punch of all of us,” he shouted breathlessly. “We'll keep her distracted!”

We dropped to all fours and lunged forward. “We're going for her wings!” I shouted at Wilson.

“You'll be burnt to a crisp!”

We ignored him. Instead, as she readied her next attack, we jumped onto a clung to her tail. She let out a soft growl as if we were a mere nuisance.

The flames traveled up her body once more and almost entirely engulfed us. We were forced to let go with a muffled shriek as fire instantly began to burn hungrily at our fur and skin. The dusty wind and fall proved to be enough to put it out, but it had done its job. Blood began to drip from our fur, staining the sand red.

Her next attack hit our arm, slicing through fur and skin like a knife through butter.

Apparently, that was enough for her, and she turned her attack back to Wilson. We struggled to stand, but staying conscious was a chore, let alone getting to our feet. We let out a faint cry that was equal parts pain and relief as we felt a cold hand on our shoulder.

“THIS IS NOT YOUR TIME TO DIE. YOU HAVE TO GET UP.”

“We can't,” I gasped. “It... it burns...”

Suddenly, we were engulfed in a chilly and damp embrace. At any other time, we would've been shocked for our frenemy to hug us like that, until we realized that it was likely the only thing that helped our burns to feel any better. With WX's help, we got to our feet and shook the blood off of us. He looked utterly disgusted at having shown any sign of affection. "THAT IS THE BEST I CAN DO UNTIL WE CAN GO BACK HOME."

“We got this now,” I assured him. He nodded a single time. “Get back into the fight. Don't worry about us.”

Every step felt like we were walking on hot coals, but we pushed through until we were able to stand one more in the heat of the battle.

We were either just in time... or too late.

The Dragonfly locked her eyes on Wilson.

She batted us and WX away like we were mere insects that were flying around her head.

Wilson...

She raised her claws to strike.

Wilson raised his morning star to defend.

“DODGE!” WX shouted, but the crackling flames swallowed his voice whole. Wilson closed his eyes and braced himself.

Her arm descended, flames following the trail of movement.

Wilson's morning star exploded into shrapnel on impact.

“Wilson!”

The head of his weapon landed by our feet.

Something opened its eyes deep inside our mind. Something that had been waiting for a very long time. Something that had barely stirred since the day we were born.

WX dropped his attack to rush towards our fallen companion, leaving the fiery form of the Dragonfly to hover menacingly in front of us. Her eyes glowed like lava restrained behind simple glass. A simple flick of her claws sprouted a new wall of flame between our friends and us. It licked at our fur and threatened to scorch us further.

We barely batted an eye.

The burns, the blood pouring from our arm, the pain of it fell away.

The sounds, the crackling heat, WX's desperate attempts to stir Wilson, they were all unimportant.

The Dragonfly seemed to buzz impatiently.

A familiar yet unfamiliar growl rose up in our throat. We dropped to all fours, claws all out and digging deep into the dirt.

If we didn't know any better, we almost could see unease pass over the beast's face.

She killed Wilson.

Three words. One line of thought.

She killed Wilson.

We lifted up the head of the morning star. It was strangely heavy when it wasn't at the end of a wooden grip. Only a small shard of wood still stuck out from where the full weapon had once been.

“You killed Wilson!”

We tried to rush her and climb her tail, but we were simply thrown off once more.

“You killed...!”

She dipped her head to spew fire from her snout, but it was the opportunity we needed.

“You killed the only father I had left!”

The skin of her neck split under the pressure of the morning star. She tried to raise her head to knock me off, but I managed to hang on stubbornly.

He wasn't my father, but he could've been. Should've been. We could've escaped together, and I wouldn't have been alone.

The Dragonfly let out an earth-shattering screech as I planted my feet on her neck, then managed to get gravity to help. Her scales fell to the ground as the skin holding them on broke apart. Blood poured heavier and heavier until we hit the ground. From her chin to the curve of her body, a wide, thick gash had been carved out by the remnants of the morning star. She extended her claws and came forth a final burst of fire.

I braved the heat, ignoring the smell of burning fur. The dust thrown up by the fiery wind would be enough to put it out.

Her eyes burned with hate and anger, but her strength was failing fast. She collapsed to the ground.

The world around me seemed to grow greener. Tiny shoots of grass that had been withered by the sun suddenly sprouted back up to the sky. The thorny trees that rooted in the desert sands grew leaves for the first time ever.

The summer seemed to drain from the world until it became a warmth rather than a heat. The redness in my vision began to fade away until I fell to my knees. A long, soft breath escaped the Dragonfly's chest, and then her form disappeared into the dust.

We collapsed onto the ground, panting heavily as the pain returned to us. We numbly saw WX taking something that the Dragonfly had dropped and staring at it with disdain. Still holding the egg-shaped object, he came to help us up once more. The coolness of his body barely served to revive us.

“I TRIED.”

His voice was soft, pained. He helped us to stumble towards our fallen friend.

“Oh, Wilson...” Our head drooped, and we struggled away from WX until we could sit beside Wilson. Blood still soaked the sand beneath him, but any force that was once behind it was gone. We rested our head against his chest, pain swelling into a lump in our throat.

“HE WOULD HAVE DIED ALMOST INSTANTLY,” WX said. We looked back up at him. We managed to stay dry-eyed, but only barely. “HE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT ANY PAIN.”

“We should've saved him. We could've...”

“IT WAS AS IF HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT MAKE IT OUT OF THIS BATTLE ALIVE.” WX shook his head. “IT IS NONE OF OUR FAULTS.”

We remained silent, closing our eyes for a long moment. “We wanna go home.”

“CAN YOU WALK?”

Without even trying to, we denied. WX frowned deeply, his eyeless gaze switching between us and Wilson's bloody body. Then, he sighed.

“WE HAVE ALL THAT WE GOT HERE. LET'S GO.”

“WX?”

“...WHAT?”

“Now what will we do?” We blinked slowly at him, feeling utterly empty.

“JUST AS WE'VE ALWAYS DONE.”

“Just... without Wilson.” We slept for a full day after the fight. We kept falling in and out of sleep, though. It was hazy... and everything hurt.

Even worse, though, there was no tooth to be found in the wreckage.

We didn't know what we were going to do without the item we fought her for.

The next twenty-four hours after that were a blur of heat and pain with only an occasional moment of relief whenever a cold hand or birchnutful of water would sooth our burns.

It wasn't until the third day we were conscious again.

The voice in our head remained silent as if even he were respecting our right to grieve. We didn't cry, but we felt like we couldn't. We couldn't tell if we were sad or just... empty. Shocked. Unable to comprehend that Wilson was dead.

Wilson, the one who had always been nice to us and had taken care of us every time something happened.

Wilson, the brains, the smart guy who kept us all on track.

Wilson, the one who had all but taken us under his wing as his own.

Our friend. Our family. Our father figure.

Gone forever.

WX kept a respectful distance for the first hour or so after we had climbed out of the initial shock. Finally, though, we heard crunching feet as the robot walked up behind us.

“COME ON.”

We looked up, blinking slowly.

“I HAVE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.”

The burns we had sustained had already started to fade. They felt less like second-degree burns from literally being on fire and more like bad sunburns. It hurt, but we could walk. Still, getting ourself to stand was enough to cause us to wince. There was little sympathy in the automaton's eyeless gaze.

He led us back towards the battlefield, silence hanging over the both of us like a predator waiting to strike. It was just us now. We knew this, but we still almost expected to hear his worried voice fretting over us making the trek so soon after being so near to death.

He stopped us just at the line between the trees and the desert where the Dragonfly had once ruled, although it looked a lot less like a desert now. The blue goats that had roamed the sands had appeared to move elsewhere, and dark green shoots were already growing through the sand. The wind had blown away almost all signs of bloodshed. The only thing that stood out to us now was the scent of freshly churned dirt, and our eyes fell on the slight mound of earth that the smell was coming from.

WX blinked slowly, then turned away. “IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG TO LEAVE HIS BODY ON THE SANDS FOR THE VULTURES TO CONSUME. I BURIED HIM WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP.” He turned to us after a moment of hesitation. “BUT... I FIGURED YOU WANTED A CHANCE TO SAY YOUR FINAL GOODBYES.”

“Final goodbyes...” I echoed. We slowly walked up to the unmarked grave where our fallen friend lay. “Wilson, thank you for letting us get this far. If it weren't for you, we would've died many times over. You... you were proud of us when nobody had been for years. You... helped me to remember what it felt like to be a kid again.” We rested a furry hand on the dirt, feeling pain swell beneath our coat. “We shouldn't have let you die,” I added. “But your death won't go in vain. You... were the best father a child could've asked for.” We smiled slightly, swallowing back tears. We would not cry- we would not. “I just hope that... wherever you are now, you're free. From guilt and pain and hunger. If angels do exist, then... you'll be the most noble addition to their ranks.” We hung our head. “We wish we would've had the chance to call you pa while you were alive.”

“I HATE TO BE THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS.”

We stiffened slightly, squeezing our eyes shut. Not crying, we were not crying, we would never cry again, no. Our eyes remained dry.

“BUT IT IS MERELY A FACT OF ORGANIC LIFE. IT IS FLEETING AND FAR FROM ETERNAL.” WX shrugged. “BUT I SUPPOSE IT IS A GOOD THING THAT HE WILL NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE STRUGGLES OF EXISTING ANYMORE.”

“You believe that souls don't exist?” We looked up.

“I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THEY DO, BUT THE SENTIMENT IS THERE. NOW THAT THAT IS OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM-” He turned away. “WE HAVE WORK TO DO.”

“You really don't care, do you?”

He hesitated.

“You're not... glad, are you?”

“OF COURSE NOT. BUT IT WOULD BE WRONG TO GIVE FALSE HOPE TO SOMEONE SUCH AS YOURSELF. AND YOU MAY HAVE THE AGE OF A CHILD, BUT YOU NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACT LIKE ONE. IT IS ONLY US NOW, AND WE HAVE TO PICK UP THE SLACK.”

“Right,” I responded bitterly. “Because you don't have 'friends' or 'family'. You only care for yourself, don't you?”

“I CARE FOR SURVIVAL, NOT YOUR HAPPINESS!” Before we even heard his words all the way through, a sharp pain blossomed through our cheek that caused us to end up on the ground. His 'eyes' were wide as if he did not intend to strike out, but they were also blazing with intensity. “YOU CANNOT BE A COWARD OR CANNON FODDER ANYMORE. IT IS YOU AND I AGAINST EVERYTHING NOW, AND ONLY TWO GIANTS ARE DEAD.”

“It feels like...we're losing our family all over again.”

He crossed his arms. “BOO HOO. AT LEAST YOU HAD A FAMILY. NOW LET'S GO BEFORE WE STAY OUT TOO LATE.”

We took one last long look at our friend's grave before digging one claw into the dirt to write a short epitaph into the mud.

 

'Wilson

Loved by all who knew him'

A moment of hesitation passed before we made one last addition.

'Survived by his only son, Tyler'

…

The smell of salt was so strong that we could smell nothing else. Even though the sun wasn't blazing as it had been before the fight, the cool water still felt absolutely amazing on our burns. A soft whimper sounded from behind us, and our faithful hound nudged his way under our hand. “Popsicle,” I said with a faint smile. “...thank you.”

Popsicle barked softly and stretched out on our lap. The sun was beginning to set, and while it should have been a threatening sign, it cast gorgeous shades of red and orange on the water of the sea.

“What do you think we should do, Pop?” I asked, rubbing at the hound's soft ears. “Is it worth it to go on fighting these beasts? What if we lose WX? Or you?”

Popsicle licked our hand and nuzzled into our fur.

“What happens if we end up alone?” Our voice was small against the pounding waves. “Will it even be worth the risk to get home?”

He was silent, turning his bright eyes to lock onto ours.

“You're right.” We stood, disturbing Popsicle enough for him to move. We kept one hand on his head as we looked out over the ocean once more. “We can't let Wilson die in vain. This is what he would want us to do, isn't it? He was always the most optimistic about this challenge... and if we gave up on it, and if he can see us... he would be sad.”

He barked, louder this time, his tail wagging.

“Let's go home, buddy.” Personally, I thought I was doing a fantastic job of keeping a level head despite everything. For one, our rates of survival dropped quite dramatically after Wilson was killed and I had yet to even mention that part, not to mention that Webber was being the most annoyingly mopey that he could possibly be.

Okay, well, maybe I shouldn't have been upset with his grief. He was too young to be having to deal with this sort of tragedy. Then again, a particularly nasty thought shot back. Would he rather he be kicked out? Left to fend for himself? Deal with this world by himself?

Another, softer, more wrong voice of reason, resonating within broken codes among broken wires. Can you imagine losing your father- not once, but twice?

I couldn't imagine that, particularly because I had been built by a single, female being who I considered to be anything but my mother, but also because it likely wasn't something I was built to be able to comprehend. Some might have taken that as a sign that robots were inferior- what 'superior' creature was unable to empathize like that?- but seeing as what grief had done to Webber... well, I was glad I couldn't understand.

The day was pleasant- as all of the days had been since the Dragonfly's demise. It was warmer than usual, but not in a painfully scorching sort of way. It was just bright and warm enough for the savanna grass to burn very slightly beneath my footsteps, and just warm enough for the hilly grasslands to be dotted with sleepy, sunbathing rabbits. I already dragged two dead rabbits behind me, leaving behind a smear of red shining in the field of orange. Webber matched my pace, his steps clumsy and his eyes glazed. He was clearly a hunter, down to his very appearance, but he had failed to be fast enough to catch even a single rabbit. Wilson would've been concerned that he was feeling ill, considering how Webber was, by far, the fastest of our entire group.

Wilson would've...

“ARE YOU ILL?”

His whiskers twitched and rose just a bit. I could see confusion in his eyes as he struggled to match up the present with whatever daydream he was in the middle of. Then, he simply shrugged and looked down. “No.”

A twinge of annoyance. You won't get anywhere with him. If you try to argue, he'll argue back twice as hard. Was that something I had learned on my own or was that something that Wilson had taught me? He had a way with the kid, so maybe it wouldn't hurt to follow his example. “YOU WILL NOT GET FAR IF YOU FALL ILL. PERHAPS YOU HAVE REJOINED THE DAILY CHORES TOO EARLY. YOU ARE STILL AT RISK FOR INFECTION.”

Webber suddenly bristled. “Don't even try to pretend like you care,” he hissed. “You can't replace Wilson, no matter what you do!”

“OF COURSE NOT. AFTER ALL, IF I REPLACED WILSON, WHO WOULD REPLACE ME?”

He twitched his whiskers again in response, but this time it was less in agitation and more in confusion.

“IF I REPLACED WILSON, THEN MY SPOT WOULD BE OPEN. THEN WHO WOULD FILL THAT? UNFORTUNATELY, THOUGH, FOR THE TIME BEING, I MUST DO MY BEST TO FILL AT LEAST ONE CRUCIAL ROLE.”

He huffed. “Yeah, what are you going to do? Send us to our room?”

“I WOULD NOT WANT TO ACT LIKE I WAS RELATED TO YOU EVER IF IT DID MAKE YOU USEFUL. IF I CANNOT GET THROUGH TO YOU LIKE HIM, I WILL GET THROUGH TO YOU LIKE MYSELF.” I glared down at him. “YOU ARE USELESS. IN YOUR CURRENT STATE, I MAY AS WELL LEAVE YOU FOR THE HOUNDS. THE DOG HAS BEEN MORE USE THAN YOU LATELY. YOU INSIST THAT YOU ARE AS STRONG AS ANY ADULT, BUT THE MOMENT YOU LOSE SUPERVISION, YOU TURN INTO THIS. IS THIS WHAT YOU TRULY ARE? BECAUSE IF SO, I DO NOT WANT TO BE IN YOUR ACQUAINTANCE ANYMORE.”

“You can speak so easily!” He barked. Light glinted off of freshly unsheathed claws. “You've never lost anyone!”

“I NEVER HAD ANYONE!” I shouted back. Suddenly blinded by rage that was against anyone but him, I grabbed his arm and dragged his face closer to mine. “YOU ACT AS IF LOSING SOMEONE IS THE WORST THING TO HAPPEN TO YOU! I WAS BUILT TO REPLACE, TO FILL A VOID THAT MY VERY CREATOR DENIED EXISTING. MY OWN CREATOR TRIED TO MURDER ME FOR DOING THAT JOB TOO WELL! YOU SIT AROUND AND MOPE AND WHINE ABOUT HAVING NO PARENTS ANYMORE, BUT I NEVER HAD ANY!” Harshly, but not hard enough to intentionally hurt him, I smacked his mouth. “THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE SPEAKING OUT OF LINE!”

Webber didn't even try to stop me from hitting him. He simply let his body collapse sideways and smack against the ground with a hollow thump. He slowly rose to his feet again, keeping his eyes low. When he finally looked back up, his eyes were glistening unnaturally bright. I took a step back, suddenly unsure.

“Oh gosh... he's really gone, isn't he? It really is just us now, isn't it?” He let out a soft, harsh laugh. “It's so hard for us to actually put it in perspective but... oh Wilson...” he raised a clawed hand to his head and brush his fingers through his fur, tugging free a knot aggressively as he did so. “He's probably so upset at us from wherever he is...” I instinctively winced. He didn't seem to be able to grasp the concept that Wilson was gone gone. He folded his hands, shaking visibly as he took several deep breaths. “We keep thinking that he's just gonna be there, but he's not, is he? Never again. If-if we had known that that would've been his last battle-” he choked on his words. I was rather impressed that he didn't shed any tears. “We would've told him how much he meant to us. There was so much we never said to him and it's... it's eating away at us, WX.” It was easy to forget just how young he actually was. I couldn't help but think of how small he was compared to everything else in the world. He was barely half my size, his voice still high-pitched with youth even with the natural growl. “We try to be strong because if we don't try, then this world will destroy us.” His whiskers twitched. “Whatever you say, WX, it's different for us. You were created to be emotionless. To hate. We don't have the luxury. We're... I'm... sorry if my emotions get in the way of things, but we can't get rid of them.” He opened his arms helplessly. “That's how we were made.”

I stared at him for a long moment, my mind running through possible things to say. I felt a twinge of pain, but shoved it away. “MY PROGRAMMING DOES NOT TELL ME WHO I AM,” I said after a long moment. “WHILE I CANNOT FEEL THE DEPTH OF EMOTION THAT YOU CAN, I KNOW THE CONCEPT OF WHAT THEY ARE.” Webber looked up at me. “IT IS TRUE THAT YOU CANNOT HELP FEELING THEM, AND I WAS WRONG TO BE SO HARSH WITH YOU.”

He hesitated, looking unsure. “...This isn't something you would say. What are you trying to do?”

“NO MATTER HOW INTENSELY YOU CLAIM THE CONTRARY, YOU ARE JUST AS MENTALLY UNSTABLE AS ANY CHILD YOUR AGE. YOU REQUIRE A ROLEMODEL.”

He bared his teeth. “We don't need a role model!” He snapped. “Why can't you just accept that I loved him like my own father! I don't need an adult! I need Wilson!” He broke away and took off into the forest.

I reached out for him. “WEBBER!” Just as I expected though, he didn't turn. I took a step towards him but stopped myself. It was true I didn't understand emotions in the same way he did, but I thought I was understanding better.

...apparently not.

This was something he needed some time alone for.

I didn't know where he planned to go. Maybe he just needed to get as far away from the battlefield as possible. Maybe he wanted to go to where Wilson was buried to try to talk to him again.

I stared after where he disappeared, feeling a strange ache in my chest. All I could do was hope that nothing happened while he was gone.

Something told me that the only way to fix all of this would be if Wilson miraculously came back, and surely Webber knew as well as I did that that could never happen. Her footsteps echoed eerily in the long hallway. Her long, black dress gently brushed against the cool tile behind her as she walked. Her body was thin and beautiful, and her face could've been described as such as well if it weren't for the empty, dark shadows swirling in the depths of her pupils. Darkness swarmed her body, demonizing her beauty into something sinister. Behind her was a man, limping painfully with his wrists tied together with rough rope. He had deep bags under his eyes and scars lacing his body. While he wore a shirt when he had woken up, he had almost immediately abandoned it due to it having being shredded and barely hanging on to him anyway. His hair, which had always been fluffy and rather clean in life, was now tangled and messy.

“The Gentleman Scientist has been killed,” Charlie announced as she finally entered the Throne Room. Hundreds of white eyes watched from the darkness, but none were as prominent as the glowing red eyes that hid amongst them. The air was still and stale despite howling wind echoing from somewhere in the distance. As soon as she was close enough to the Nightmare Captor, she dropped into a bow and dumped her charge in front of her. He let out an audible oof as he tumbled onto the ground on all fours.

Maxwell was perched on the Nightmare Throne, just as he had been for as long as anyone could remember. While Charlie's corruption tainted her natural beauty, Maxwell looked as if he had never been handsome. His limbs were thin and atrophied, his face so thin that his cheekbones and jawline protruded almost unnaturally from his form. Charlie felt a twinge in her chest as she gazed at the man she once loved, but she didn't let anything break past her exterior.

Maxwell leaned forward as far as the binds of the Nightmare Throne would let him. He stared at the prisoner for a long moment, his expression slowly shifting before he sat back. “We didn't need him. Where is the boy?”

Charlie winced and almost found herself shaking under his empty gaze. She took a deep breath, then answered: “Maxwell, the boy is destroyed without him. It can't be long before he follows.”

“But the robot is alive.”

“...yes.”

“Then he has something to live for.”

“I...” Charlie swallowed. “Yes.”

Suddenly, something seemed to flip in Maxwell like a switch. He raised his index fingers to his temple and massaged it for a moment. “There has to be five of them.”

“Yes, I know.”

“There must be.” He sounded desperate. The prisoner looked up slowly, staring at Maxwell with empty gray eyes as if resigned already to his fate. “I do not want him.”

The prisoner winced as if he had been physically hit.

“What do you want me to do, then?” Charlie could feel the air shift as something drew closer.

Maxwell blinked slowly at her as if hoping to get some sort of message across. Charlie felt dread settle in her stomach. Maxwell rarely tried to get messages across without alerting Them, and even though she was usually able to read minds, Maxwell's had a veil of shadows around it. However, she understood this time. There was only one thing that he would want her to do that They couldn't know about. She bowed to her king, feeling her heart pounding softly beneath her clothes. “...Yes, sir.” You're in there somewhere, William... I miss you so much. Maybe you will be with me again after our roles are passed down. She smiled faintly as the image of their heir came to her mind, but she immediately shooed it away.

Soon.

“How... is the fourth?” She asked after a long, painfully tense pause. “It has been a long time since I was in the archipelago. Not since...”

“He... has been worse.” Maxwell waved her off. “But that lies in our favor. If he finds it difficult to live a day to day life, anything above that will be impossible.”

“I see.” Over the many years together as Nightmare Captor and Servant, Charlie had learned that Maxwell seemed to act similar to an on and off switch. It was a talent to pick out what words were from Them speaking through him and what words came from William. Then again, she sometimes found it hard to believe that William even existed anymore. What if They were trying to force Charlie into a state of comfort? She swallowed her discomfort and pressed on. “And the fifth?”

“...I don't know.”

“They are still invisible to you?” When Maxwell said nothing, she felt herself jumping in to fill the silence. “It can't be for much longer, sir. After all, you were able to see the others once they came into the world, couldn't you?”

“What are you talking about?” Her prisoner cried. Ah, she had almost forgotten that he was still here. It didn't matter much. He was likely still too out of it to comprehend much of what they were saying, let alone remember it. “Five... who are you talking about?” He sounded like he was trying to be angry, but his voice pitched towards the end, betraying his terror and confusion.

Charlie whispered softly, just loud enough that her prisoner could hear her words-

“The Reign of Giants will come and go

Shipwrecked will he, we'll never know

When finally, the end of lives

Begins with the fall of five”

“...what?” His voice was quiet, too. Maybe he understood. Maybe he didn't.

“You should know more than anyone that the future is fuzzy.” Maxwell's response showed that he either didn't hear or didn't care. Then again, it was probably the least of his worries, even if he had heard. “After all, it was wrong last time, was it not?”

Charlie winced.

“Dismiss yourself, Charlie. You have work to do.”

She hesitated, then forced herself into a bow. “Yes, sir.” Staying around any longer would only cause more problems. She turned, tugging on the rope around her prisoner's wrists. She heard him stumble to keep up with her, but she was paying more attention to the murmurs behind her as They whispered her words over and over again. “Erika!” I cried. “Please!” Our voice echoed in the darkness of the vast cave system. It came back to our ears without response or acknowledgment that it was heard. Pain rose in our chest and we slowly lowered ourself to the ground. “Erika, I need you!” We hadn't seen her since the flood. Terror rose in our chest. What if something happened to her? What if I lost her before I got to see her as she was? The caves were silent: no pattering of spider footsteps, no distant hissing of conversation, no eyes shining in the darkness. If Erika was lost in the flood... we really did have no family left. We should have checked earlier. But... if spiders had died in that, wouldn't their bodies still be here? There had to have been at least enough alive to clean up any bodies. Right? But then... what happened to their sentries?

We took a deep breath and released it. No, we had to keep believing that she was okay. There was no way that she knew anything about our past. If she was busy, it would only make sense that we would be the least of her worries.

We lowered ourself to the cold stone, almost relishing the feeling against our skin, and wrapped our arms around ourself. We felt bad for getting angry at WX the way we did, but every word he said just seemed to burn the hole in our heart. We couldn't blame him; it really wasn't his fault. However, it didn't matter whether he meant to hurt us or not. We needed time. To readjust, to cope with what we had seen and who we had lost, to just get ourself back on track. And... to reconsider our goals. Was it worth it trying to fight these beasts without Wilson? Could WX and I fight any of them without him?

We didn't want to let Wilson die in vain, but he wouldn't want us to put ourselves in situations that would end up badly. He was too smart for that.

He also really wouldn't want us moping in a cave. We let out a harsh laugh as we remembered how upset he got when we had been taken in by the cave spiders the first time. We didn't want to make WX worry the same way.

This time, we were smart enough to tie a rope to a tree in the surface so we could get out. Our past experiences in the caves had taught us that, at least. We climbed back to the surface in a few quick moments and took a moment to look at the sky above. We had time until autumn- plenty of time to prepare and to reconsider the future.

We took our time walking home. It was beginning to turn dark, but we knew we still had plenty of time until the Night Monster emerged.

I wonder what the Night Monster looks like. It had to have some sort of physical form, right? WX had said that he had been able to sense it moving and that it definitely seemed to have some sort of physical presence, but none of us had seen it.

“Of course she has a physical form,” a voice hissed in the back of our mind. “How little of a spider do you have to be to gain her attention? We have all seen her, but she never attacks us. We're her allies.”

“I'm not her ally,” I snapped. “And I don't claim to be a spider. Why would I want to be you?”

“I'm certain that if you fought against survivors rather than for them, she would love to work with you,” he purred. “After all, you could very well pass off as one of us instead of one of them.”

“I would rather fight against everything the world has to throw at us than be anything like you.”

“That's harsh. I don't recall doing anything to you.”

“You ate me!”
“That was in the past. I learned my lesson. We've been together for so long, though, that I would've thought you would've learned to trust me more.”

I took a shaky breath. “You never do anything other than torture me.”

“I showed you the truth, didn't I?”

I felt my blood suddenly freeze in my veins as an image pounded through my head. The bodies that he had shown us, during the winter. The blood.

My voice broke. “You knew.”

“It's only destiny, you know.”

“You knew that Wilson was going to die, and you knew he was going to die in that battle!” I felt my step falter and my heart begin to pound painfully in my ears. “Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me so that I could've stopped this! I could've stopped the battle before it happened!”

He scoffed. “Nothing could've stopped that battle. No matter what you said, fate would've won out in the end. I would be less concerned about the past and more concerned about the future.”

“WX,” I whispered.

“Soon, you'll be alone.”

“I won't! I-I'll stop it.”

“You can't.”

I growled, deep in my throat. “Leave me alone.”

“Fine. But me staying quiet won't change anything.”

I didn't give a response, but I could tell that he could sense my anger and fear and was amused by it. It would be impossible for me to try to come up with anything to combat him; I knew he could hear my every thought. The last thing I wanted to do was give him the enjoyment of having me continue to think about him, so I forcibly cleared my mind of nothing but the grass beneath my feet and the feel of the wind through my fur.

We didn't expect a welcome home party from WX, and we certainly didn't get one. He had built up a fire and was staring into the flames. We hesitated at the edge of camp, almost hovering at the edge of the light for a few moments. We weren't sure what to say.

“I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE FOR TRYING TO HELP,” WX said with a glance at us. Ah, yes, what a conversation starter.

“We didn't expect you to.”

“-BUT I SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR FAILING TO DO SO.”

We blinked. He shrugged.

“I COULD USE YOUR USELESSNESS AS A REASON, BUT FRANKLY, I WOULD RATHER BE HONEST. I THOUGHT I DISLIKED YOU BEFORE, BUT THIS IS SOMEHOW WORSE.”

We let out a soft laugh, surprising him as well as ourself. “At least you're being honest with yourself.”

He almost seemed to puff up. “I AM NEVER DISHONEST WITH MYSELF.”

“Sure.” We shook our head slightly. “You're known for only speaking the truth.” Our gaze drifted to something sitting beside WX- something black and red. “...wha... that's Wilson's book.”

“IT IS.”

“Where did you find it?” We never saw it unless Wilson was actively looking through it. If WX had found his hiding place before, he definitely would've stolen it much more often just to be a nuisance.

He shrugged. “IT WAS JUST HERE, BY THE FIRE.”

“It wasn't before...” we took a few steps closer to it but winced away. There was something wrong with it. “Don't you feel that?”

“WHAT?”

“That... I dunno, darkness?” We inched closer again, bracing ourself against the sensation. Our fur prickled as we lifted the book off of the ground. It made our hands tingle and quickly numb, but we forced ourself to keep a hold of it. After all, it was the last thing we had left-

A surge of adrenalin forced us to drop the book, and we snapped our gaze back to WX, who looked equally terrified.

Something happened. We couldn't explain it- we probably never could. Before we even had the chance to properly try to understand it, our body limply crumpled forward, missing the fire by only a few inches.

It felt like something was dragged out of our soul.

…

The book.

Something had happened with the book.

It was supposed to say everything about the world, but it never said anything about raising the dead. It was illogical, impossible.

But then again, I couldn't think of any other reason.

I refused to call it magic. Magic was the opposite of science, and therefore impossible.

Death was supposed to be permanent, wasn't it?

Then what was this?

It couldn't be life. Death was permanent. This was the basis of everything that we as humans do. Once we died, there was no going back.

No, this was something else. Something that had to be scientifically plausible.

After all, what kind of scientist would I be if I accepted anything as it seemed? There was a fire in the pit of our gut. It felt purely as if someone had taken our very soul and tore it in two. We felt like we wanted to scream in agony, but we couldn't. Had the book done this to us? What happened to WX? Was he okay?

Pulling out of sleep was one of the hardest things we had ever done. It felt like we were fighting an uphill battle just for control of our own waking self. The struggle was enough that when we finally managed to open our eyes, our vision was still painfully blurry. We sucked in several deep breaths and rubbed our eyes furiously.

Slowly, we were able to drag ourselves to our knees. It felt like there was a heavy weight on our back. We were dazed, the world was tipping around us, even though we were still on the ground.

“Webber?”

We couldn't even correctly recognize the voice. It could've been anyone, likely WX, but there was something about it that immediately brought tears to our eyes. We swallowed them back and looked up.

“Webber!” The voice was now dripping with relief. We stared up at the person in front of us, our throat raw. A hand rested on our head and another wrapped around our back.

“What happened?” Our voice was small, so small we almost expected him to be unable to hear it. However, he smiled at us. “No, we- we didn't... we can't die... we were supposed to avenge you...”

“...Webber...?”

“I'm sorry, papa.”

“Wake up, you're speaking nonsense.” He shook our shoulders, and we shook our head at him.

“No, no, I don't wanna wake up. We can't stop thinking about how badly we failed you during the battle against the Dragonfly. We were supposed to be a team and get out together, but you-you...” We bit furiously at our tongue, struggling to keep tears from flowing. “She killed you and we didn't stop her in time and- and- and-”

“Please, calm down, I'm really here, Webber. Please, it's okay, I promise.” He pulled us into a hug, running a hand through the fur in the back of our head. We instinctively pressed our face into his shoulder, shaking like a leaf.

“I'm sorry, Wilson,” I whimpered.

“WEBBER? WHAT ARE YOU...-” A distinctly robotic voice broke through our conversation. WX was pulling himself off of the ground. At first, his words were directed at us, but his voice abruptly stopped when his eyeless gaze landed on the scientist. His mouth hung open for a long moment, and he scrambled to a standing position to take a step closer. “...WILSON?” His voice pitched in confusion. He looked up and down, clearly taking in every detail of their supposedly fallen friend.

Wilson slowly peeled us away from him and took a step towards WX. He wrung his hands together and stared at them for a long moment. “I... I want to explain. I really do... but I don't know.”

WX shook his head, his mouth still hanging open. “WE WATCHED YOU DIE. WE- I BURIED YOUR BODY.”

Wilson smiled and wiped a forming tear away from his eyes. “I know you did.”

We growled to ourself. “N-No, don't do this to me. Do anything you want, Webber, but please, not this... this is torture.” We covered our eyes, our breaths ragged.

Wilson offered us a hand, and we took it. His hand was warm, almost unnaturally so. “Webber,” his voice was thick with emotion. “I really am here right now. I don't know what happened.” He looked into the distance, staring at something beyond their range of vision. “I... I remember fighting the Dragonfly with you guys. I remember seeing her claws coming down, and then... darkness. I think there was someone else... I...” His eyes suddenly glazed over, as if he was thinking of something terrifying. “Where's my book?” He demanded, his voice changing on a dime. Our gaze snapped back up to him, but he seemed deeply distracted. “I-I need to write something down.”

WX, his confusion having not dropped in the slightest, pulled the dark book from his bag and extended his arms for Wilson to see it. Wilson said nothing, only snatched it hastily and ripped a piece of charcoal from the fire. We felt our whiskers twitching in confusion, but my emotions were everything but confusion. In fact, I couldn't care less about how he came back, only that he was really here right now and he wasn't dead and-

“What!? No! I- this can't be- but- fate-”

Wilson was writing furiously in the book, his gray eyes narrowed and the charcoal making sharp and almost violent strokes across a page. Hesitantly, we edged closer. What could be more important than the fact that he was alive?

After he finished writing whatever it was he was writing, he crushed the piece of charcoal into dust and he stared at whatever words he had written with a sort of ferocious intensity. When he saw us looking at him, he clamped the book closed before we could see what he had written inside. “It doesn't matter,” he growled to himself, shaking his head. We could see thick bands of bruises on his wrists, as if something heavy had once been attached to them.

A moment later, though, he seemed to snap out of it. He blinked several times as if to clear something, then looked at us again. His eyes immediately softened. “I'm sorry,” he said. “I'm just... I'm trying to process everything.”

We smiled sadly, and blinked up at him. “I don't care,” I said softly. Before he could open his mouth to ask, we wrapped our arms around him. We felt safe, safer than we had felt in so many years. Wilson didn't even seem to mind it. Actually, he seemed to embrace it, bending down to hold us like a child again. A soft purr rose in our throat as we rested our head on his shoulder. “I was so scared,” I whimpered. “I... I thought I had lost you forever...”

Wilson was silent for a long moment, his gray eyes desperately pained but also so, so hopeful, as if he was finally getting to see a side of us that he had never seen before. We wanted to be strong. We wanted to be independent and dependable.

But more than that, we wanted a family again.

“Can...” I began, but cut myself off. No, that was stupid. We were nothing but a scientific anomaly to him, nothing else. We were teammates, not family, and we had to remember that. But at the same time, the look Wilson was giving us was so familiar and so proud that the question desperately bubbled up in our chest again.

“Can... what?”

We looked down at the ground, then at WX, who was still standing several feet away. His mouth had finally closed, but the confusion in his gaze hadn't lightened up any. When we finally looked at him again, it took everything from us to keep from crying. “Crying is weak we are not weak we are strong and we always have to be strong-”

“Can I call you papa?” I asked in a tiny voice. I almost expected him not to respond, or to abruptly drop us or anything of the like. It was such a weird question, such an uncomfortable question, one that nobody could agree to-

“Webber...” his voice faltered.

We felt ourself begin to shake again, and we grasped onto his shirt desperately. “It's been so long since we've been wanted and- and we kept telling ourself that our family was gone and we didn't need them anymore but- but-” it was hard to speak. We could barely get the words to form in our mind, let alone speak them aloud. “You're not my papa and I know you're not but we just- we want-”

“Webber.” Wilson's voice was more firm this time, but it had taken on a note that was so familiar it ached. There were tears running down his cheeks, and he rubbed them away with his wrist as he gently placed us back on the ground. He stayed crouching however, to stay face-to-face with us. “You can call me whatever you want to.”

We let out a cry of pure happiness and hugged him again, even more furiously this time. The purr in our throat had become much louder all of a sudden, but we didn't try to hide the obviously spider trait. Everything from the past several years of our lives: my consumption, the rejection from my family, the years of starvation and living on our own, it didn't matter. All of it led to here and now and we had the best friend in the world and the best father a child could ask for and he was alive and real and right here.

“What, I'm not a good enough friend?”

“WILSON,” WX broke the silence. He crossed his arms and narrowed his 'eyes' at the scientist. Wilson hesitated for a long moment, then let us go in order to face Wilson. We let out a small whimper, but he turned his head to look at us for a quick second as if to promise that he wasn't going anywhere. “THIS IS VERY TOUCHING, BUT YOU HAVE NOT EXPLAINED A SINGLE THING.” The robot spread his arms out as if waiting. “YOU DIED, AND CAME BACK TO LIFE. AND YOU MADE ME DEAL WITH WEBBER THE ENTIRE TIME.”

Wilson looked at the ground and shrugged helplessly. “I told you, I don't know. I don't know if they stripped my memories or...”

“IT DOES NOT MATTER IF IT IS DISJOINTED, WHAT ALL DO YOU REMEMBER?”

He sighed impatiently. “I said this already. I don't remember anything. I remember getting killed... and I remember that I was in someplace dark. But I don't remember anything else.”

We walked up to Wilson and pressed against his leg, purring. He startled, but upon seeing it was us, he rested a hand on our head and scratched around our whiskers.

WX frowned. “WHY DID YOU NEED THAT BOOK?”

“I remembered something,” he snapped. “I thought it was important, but it's not. Just nonsense.” He kicked the dirt. “But all that matters is that I'm back, right?”

“YOU ARE THE SCIENTIST. YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.”

“I tried to, I really did, but the truth is, I can't really figure out anything about this world. I mean, come on, I just adopted a literal spider-human hybrid, I think that's a bit weirder to me than coming back to life.”

We let out a small laugh. Wilson was right. It didn't matter how he came back, only that he was with us now.

A sharp cracking noise stole our attention away. We perked up and turned our head, trying to find the source of it.

Near the fire, the loot from the Dragonfly's hoard had been haphazardly thrown on the ground. One of the objects, one that we had vaguely noticed immediately after her defeat but never paid attention to, had developed a long, sharp split across one side. Popsicle, who had somehow remained sleeping during the entire ordeal, seemed to snap into alertness at the sound as well. The ice hound had primarily remained by our side after the fight with the Dragonfly, but we could tell that our emotions were simply too strong for the pup to be able to handle. He had been spending most of his time sleeping lazily under a tree, trying to absorb as much of the coolness of the shade as possible. This was the most alert we had seen him in awhile.

Instead of breaking away from Wilson, we tugged on his shirt and pointed towards the object. He tipped his head at us, then at the object. “Is that an egg?”

WX shrugged. “DON'T KNOW. IT WAS THE LEAST OF MY WORRIES THESE PAST FEW DAYS. I UNDERSTAND YOU FORGOT A LOT OF THINGS, BUT SURELY YOU DIDN'T FORGET THAT PART WHERE YOU DIED AND WEBBER NEARLY BURNED TO DEATH, RIGHT?”

“I'm not being judgmental,” Wilson protested. “It was just a question.”

Popsicle was the first to trudge over to the object. Almost immediately, his tongue lolled out from the heat and soft steam began to rise from his fur. However, he simply sat next to it and then stared at us, as if we were supposed to do something. We turned our gaze to Wilson, who hesitated for a long moment before pacing towards the egg himself. We heard WX let out an audible groan, but he followed us anyway as we gathered around.

Wilson was the one to step up to the egg fully, placing his hand on it for just a second before abruptly snatching it back to his chest. “Holy mother of Science that's hot!” He shouted. He furiously shook his hand while watching the egg with a weary eye. We heard WX prepare his weapon. We didn't know what kind of creature would come out of this egg; it could be literally anything.

Popsicle let out a short bark at Chester, who growled in response. The other creature seemed to care less, as usual, and was lounging on the edges of camp. Popsicle whimpered before turning his attention back.

“It's okay, little fella,” Wilson encouraged, holding out a hand but no longer attempting to touch it. As if on cue, another long crack split the surface of the shell. Popsicle leaped to his feet and his tail began wagging in excitement and puppylike wonder.

After a long, tense moment of silence, the egg seemed to split in two, and a tiny, bug-eyed little creature tumbled out alongside the contents of its egg, which appeared much more like a tight bubble of lava around the creature rather than a proper albumen. This was only reinforced by the fact that it did not fall away from the creature, and instead remained around it like a protective shield.

The creature itself was tiny, about the size of our hand, and primarily black, with a body like a plump worm and a single, sharp tooth poking from its mouth. We took a hesitant step back, an unsure frown settling on our face. “When danger is afoot, then that's where my job comes in.”

“What is that?”

“Did this come from the Dragonfly?” Wilson asked WX, who nodded. “Then... um... I guess it's a Dragonfly larvae. Or lavae, haha. But gosh it's tiny...”

“YOU KNOW MY STANCE, AND I KNOW YOU WILL IGNORE ME.”

“WX, calm down,” Wilson said with a scowl. “Don't you see how small it is? I highly doubt that we will ever see the day that this little thing even becomes our size, let alone a fully-grown Dragonfly.”

It let out a small buzz, blinking its big coal-black eyes at Wilson expectantly.

“Is it a boy or a girl?” We asked after a moment. Wilson shrugged.

“It's harder to tell with lizards. I might be totally wrong, but it feels more feminine to me.” It buzzed again, this time stretching its tiny body. It yawned- possibly?- and as it did, the sharp tooth in its mouth fell off and plopped onto the ground in front if it. We immediately recognized it as the kind of tooth that baby birds used to break out of their shells, but Wilson's eyes widened as he set eyes on it and he immediately grabbed it. “The- the Dragonfly's tooth!” He cried in ecstasy.

“Really?!” A bubble of excitement lit in our chest. Wilson lowered it to let us see, and our eyes widened. “It is!”

WX inched closer as well. “WE DID NOT FAIL AFTER ALL,” he mumbled. “WHAT ABOUT THE CREATURE?”

We looked back down at it. It appeared to have fallen asleep, the brightly glowing bubble around it melting away in a puddle around it. We crouched down, a fondness immediately growing in our chest. Popsicle seemed equally fond, his tail thumping against the ground as he looked up at us with his tongue lolling out.

Wilson looked at WX. “Don't tell me you're scared of her.”

WX scoffed, almost offended. “I AM NOT SCARED OF IT. I AM JUST WANTING YOU TO REALIZE THAT THIS IS AN INFANTILE DRAGONFLY, THAT, MIND YOU, WOULD BE JUST AS LIKELY TO ATTEMPT TO KILL YOU AS ITS MOTHER.”

“You always say that you don't want them, but you know we're gonna keep them anyway,” Wilson pointed out. He palmed the tooth, his gray eyes glittering, then crouched down to examine her closer. He put a hand on our shoulder and we found ourself purring again. “She's a hatchling,and she's so tiny that there's no way that she'll ever grow to that size in our lifetimes.”

“MAYBE NOT YOURS,” WX mumbled.

“She's asleep right now, so we can figure everything else out later.” Wilson straightened up and gave WX and I a huge grin. “We did it. We have the tooth.”

“Does that mean she was also just a mum protecting her baby?” I asked after a long moment. We had defeated two giants, and neither seemed to give us much enjoyment. Both were nothing more than mothers. We shook our head. “We have to take care of her baby for her.”

WX grumbled beneath his breath, but he knew that he was outnumbered yet again.

We had many good days and even more bad days in this world, but it was pretty safe to say that this took the cake as the best day so far. Someone, whether they be from above or below, had brought Wilson back to us, and there was a new, tiny creature under our protection. Most of all, though, our heart felt so full that we weren't entirely certain we could express it properly. Our spider was mostly keeping his mouth shut and was allowing us to enjoy these moments, and for the first time since we were five years old, we felt like we had family again.

We closed our eyes and felt the purr rise in our throat. Being a spider, it was rough and ragged, and almost sounded more like a growl, but the look in Wilson's eyes suggested that he knew exactly what it was.

And that was all that mattered. Trying to fall into sleep was an odd feeling for me. True, my death has lasted all but a few days, but I hadn't had to sleep a single time during that... I thought. I wasn't sure. I didn't remember much about being dead, but the things I did remember I didn't want to talk about. I was always cold. I was always empty. I remembered feeling lost, being a soul without a body, and heartbroken. My entire life, I hoped to die for a good cause. I hoped that I would go out with a bang, accomplishing something great.

But... I didn't want to die so young.

It was so sudden that I didn't even understand it myself. WX's voice still ringed in my ears, the very last thing I heard in those last moments. “DODGE!”

I didn't know why I didn't. I remember being totally paralyzed, watching her flame-wreathed claws descend. I had blocked, but not ran, and wood does not hold up against fire.

Seconds after I had been hit, I was still aware. I didn't hear anything, and I couldn't feel anything, but I was still able to see. Maybe I had died on impact and those few moments were before my spirit was taken. (I didn't like to believe this, however. Despite the clear evidence supporting otherwise, I couldn't come up with any plausible answer as to what a soul was. I had always been a firm believer of nothing after death. Humans were nothing more than a series of electrical signals in their brain, nothing that could be held in a supposed ball of pure energy. I stood by this idea for my entire life, which is another reason why the sensation of being dead caught me off guard so badly).

I remembered looking down and seeing... myself. But it didn't look like me. The Dragonfly's attack had borderline eviscerated my body, and blood from the gaping holes pumped onto the sand for only a few seconds before slowing to a trickle. I knew that was the moment my heart had stopped beating.

And yet, I had been aware enough to see my friends' reactions. I had seen Webber tapping into some force beyond my knowledge in order to kill the Dragonfly in a single, devastating move. And... it terrified me. He had appeared feral like that once before, when we were fighting the Goose, but this wasn't him at all. His eyes were different, hatred and malice glowing in the white orbs where passion and determination usually rested. He was different.

And I was there when WX had buried me, the robot collapsing beside the grave afterward and hanging his head in pain. I knew this is something he would never share with me or Webber, which is why I never brought it up to him.

But most importantly, the one thing that really stuck with me, was Webber's reaction. He had written in the mud, referring to himself as my son. Things seemed to swell up in my memory as I watched him write this, until I found myself silently crying.

It was after that event that things became... fuzzy at best. I remembered some sort of red beast, and I remembered chains around my wrists, but nothing else. Words bounced emptily in my mind, making little sense to me without the context. The only one that really stood out to me was five.

Finally finding sleep was a blessing. Webber had been particularly clingy to me, but I found I didn't mind. It seemed as if I was seeing a different side, the side opposite of that that had come out during the fight with the Dragonfly. That day, he was not a battle-scarred warrior or a child trying to pretend that he was much older than he really was; he was just a little kid. He was a lost, scared little boy, who wanted nothing more than someplace to call home and someone to call family.

The fact that I had been that family to him was still baffling. My mind was still reeling from the entire scene. When we had begun to settle in for bed, Webber had wasted no time in coming up to me and falling asleep in a ball with his head on my lap. I mindlessly scratched around his whiskers in my own attempts to sleep.

When I opened my eyes again, it was completely black. Immediately, terror swamped my system as warnings about the darkness crowded in. I glanced down at my hands, however, to find that I could see them perfectly fine. A quick glance over the rest of myself revealed the same thing. It wasn't dark, I was just in a black void. When I took an uneasy step back, my feet splashed as if I was standing in an inch of water.

“There you are.”

I let out a yelp of fear at the voice. I felt as if I had heard it before, but I couldn't figure out where. The memory felt distant.

“Don't be afraid,” the voice purred softly. I felt a claw gently run over my chin, not sharp enough to cut it but enough to force my chin upward. Eyes met mine, glowing red without any corporeal form for them to cling to. My breath immediately caught in my throat, and I found myself instinctively shaking.

“You are doing well in your quest,” it continued. “I watched you defeat the Dragonfly.”

“Who are you?” I managed. The question took the rest of the breath from my lungs and moisture from my mouth.

It was quiet for a long, long moment. The silence lasted for so long that I thought it had left. However, finally, a whisper sounded in my ear. “Nightmare,” it said. “You may call me... Nightmare.”

“Nightmare,” I repeated. 'Nightmare' chuckled at the shaking of my voice.

“Why are you still afraid? You now know my name. We are no longer strangers, are we?”

“I can't see you,” I said hoarsely.

“Many cannot.”

I took another step back as the eyes blinked at me. “What do you want from me?”

“Blood for blood, scientist. If you have not guessed already, I was the one given the job of bringing you back.”

“Y-You?” I stuttered.

“Of course. I am the only creature in this world capable of such powerful magic, after all.”

I nodded slowly, trying to make sense of my sluggish thoughts. “I see...”

“However, doing so has upset a delicate balance. This world is always on the very edge of destruction, you see. One mishap, one wrong step, and the world would unravel. Therefore, in order to keep this balance, the trade must be completed.”

“...okay.” I tried to think of what this creature, a creature apparently capable of great enough power to bring someone back from the dead, could possibly want from me. Its voice dropped, as if its words held a great weight.

“I revived you before They could consume your soul, the unfortunate end for many of the world's victims. However, you were here just long enough for Them to get a taste of your soul, and now they demand a sacrifice to satiate their hunger.”

My hands began to tingle. I looked down and saw an ugly black fluid clinging to the tips of my fingers and crawling up my hand. I cried out again and tried to shake it off, but the fluid held fast.

“They want a powerful soul. They want... a soul so strong it is closer to two souls, that have long since been fused together by time and circumstance. To make up for losing the soul of the Gentleman Scientist, they want the soul of the Indigestible.”

I heard that name before. It was a title, one that I knew well. When the name of its owner finally came to my mind, I felt the blood drain out of my face. “Webber,” I whispered.

“I am too weak right now to stave their hunger. You must complete the deal, Scientist.”

“I never agreed to that!” I cried. “I-I can't do that! I-I have to refuse.”

Nightmare's entire mood seemed to change. The eyes narrowed and two sharp rows of teeth appeared bared in a snarl. I tried to step back, but hundreds of cold, slimy bodies were beginning to press in and forced me to face their master. When it spoke, its voice turned the blood in my veins to ice. “You are not allowed to refuse. They demand a soul greater than the one they lost, and that is the only one.”

“No!” I shouted. I tried to ignore the way that my voice pitched with terror. “If the price for me being brought back is Webber's life, then just take me again.”

“That is not an option.” The black fluid was almost at my elbows now, and I could feel my vision pressing at the edges. “You will bring us the soul of the Indigestible!” It roared.

“No!”

I could almost feel the eyes of the beast staring through my soul. It felt like those eyes were stripping away everything and reading me from the inside. After a long moment, in where I could feel my heart progressively getting close to pounding out of my chest, Nightmare seemed to relax slightly.

“Fine. I know what you truly want, and I will give it to you if you provide this. You want freedom. I am a generous creature, and I can do this for you. You mission to defeat the beasts that call themselves the Giants will be completely forgotten. I will free you and your robotic companion without the need for the trophies of the Giants.”

The black muck had reached my shoulders and was now beginning to gather on my chest. I opened my mouth, but I wasn't sure what to say. I did desperately want to escape, but...

“Can I call you papa?”

I had to say no.

“I can't,” I choked.

“Yes you can,” Nightmare purred. “I am promising you everything you want. Without this, the world will fall into pieces.”

Falling asleep in a ball beside me, purring.

“I would rather let the world fall apart,” I growled.

It felt like cold tendrils were trying to crawl through my veins. The colder I became, the more I began to see from Nightmare's side.

“I can see the gears turning in your mind. What are you thinking?”

I shook my head. “I don't...”

“You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.”

The liquid had reached my face now, quickly covering my mouth and crawling towards my eyes. Some part of my mind, the emotional part, was screaming at me to continue to deny, to scream and shout and attack the demon for even suggesting such a thing. However... there was something else that bit at the back of my mind, as if there was some greater force beginning to control the words coming from my mouth.

“Okay,” I whispered in the last few seconds before it completely took over my vision. “I'll do it.” While the others slept, I busied myself by searching the entirety of Wilson's book, curious as to what it was he had been so desperately writing in it before brushing it off like it was nothing. There had been a look in his eye when he was writing it; his eyes had been wild and his expression tense, like he was someone forcing his hand to write. It was most likely nothing of importance, I knew, maybe a drawing of something he had remembered, but I had nothing better to do. I sat by the firelight, alternating between searching through the book at staring at my companions.

I knew very well that Webber had sort of adopted himself as Wilson's; he was terrible at pretending. Yet, I didn't expect the sort of raw emotion in his eyes when Wilson had returned to us unscathed.

Unscathed... there had to be something more behind that. Maybe I could find something in the book about that, but I doubted it. One of us would've found it by now if that was the truth. And so, I didn't keep my hopes up.

At first, my page turning had been slow, my eyes grazing over each word written by an unknown hand, but the longer I read, the quicker I began to turn the pages. Charcoal wasn't a precise written tool by any means, and I figured it would be easy to see.

I had just reached the section where each of the survivors were listed when I stopped, staring at Wilson's page.

Written in thick, heavily marked charcoal, two words had been written over and over again.

Someone else. Someone else. Someone else. Someone else. Someone else.

…

Webber was the first to wake up. I could tell because he was stirring more than usual and he would occasionally blink up at Wilson to see if he had woken up yet, but he seemed perfectly content to lay there, and he may have drifted off again.

I honestly didn't care less. The words Wilson had wrote were turning over in my head. Someone else... what is he talking about? Someone else had been there with him? Someone else killed him? Someone else what!? Why be so cryptic!

As the sun was just beginning to graze the treetops, I was struck by something. It was a similar feeling to what I had directly before Wilson returned to us. I looked up to see something standing over the scientist. If I had breath to lose, I was certain that I would have. My limbs felt held in place, and I found the idea of sleep paralysis running through my mind despite me not having sleep nor a mind to be tricked. I couldn't rightly describe it as anything other than a mass of shadows. A large portion of its body was wound around Wilson, while its claws gripped his head in order to stay upright.

As fast as it had appeared, the sensation went away, and Wilson was waking up as well. He yawned and stretched, then spared a few moments to stare at Webber before hesitantly reaching around to scratch around his whiskers. When he caught me staring at him, his eyes narrowed.

“WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?”

“What are you talking about?” He hostility in his eyes immediately cleared, and his voice tinged with confusion. “It's too early for this, WX. At least let me wake up first.”

He seemed totally normal. He blinked several times and rubbed his eyes.

“It's beautiful, isn't it? Being dead for a few days really makes you stop and think about how beautiful nature is. Like, when was the last time you just appreciated what it felt like to have the sun on your skin?” As if to emphasis his point, he stretched out his arms and sighed blissfully.

I frowned at him.

“What? Why are you looking at me like that?” He tipped his head at me. “What did I do this time? I should probably be able to guess with you at this point, but I'm lost.”

I shook my head. I couldn't explain it, and I didn't know what it even was. Wilson shrugged and nudged Webber until he was able to stand.

“What are we doing today? There's not really much for us to do until the Bearger comes back...” he shivered. “Although, I'm not looking forward to facing off against that again. I'm just excited for when we get to leave.”

I hummed, but said nothing. I knew something was wrong, but I couldn't say what. I knew that there were strange hallucinations here, but none of those hallucinations directly interacted with any of us. That shadow was hovering over Wilson, was curled around Wilson.

“Mmm... can we not work today?” Webber asked, his voice still slurred with sleep. I felt a twinge of annoyance in my chest. Wilson was glad that the boy was becoming more comfortable around us, comfortable enough to act like himself, but it frustrated me to no end. He was a survivalist first and a child second, there was no room for error, youth, or weakness, and certainly no time for play. Wilson gave him a pitying look, a look that meant I want to let you be a child but I can't let you be a child. I huffed.

“Well, I like that idea a lot... it would be nice to relax after what we all went through with the Dragonfly... but we can't really take a break. Not with another battle like that on the horizon.” He shook his head very slightly, earning a disappointed growl from the boy.

“YOU KNOW HE IS RIGHT,” I snapped. “OUR DAY-TO-DAY SURVIVAL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN FUN AND GAMES.”

Webber sighed. “We know. What are we going to be doing today, then?”

“WE ARE LOW ON MOST THINGS. I WAS UNABLE TO KEEP UP OUR STOCKS WHILE YOU WERE MOPING AND WILSON WAS... INDISPOSED OF.” I wasn't going to admit that the only reason I fell so far behind was because I couldn't stop returning to the scene of the battle, beating myself up and cursing myself for not being fast enough to save Wilson. It didn't matter now, and I certainly wasn't going to bring it up to make it matter.

Webber brightened, if only slightly. “Foraging... we can do that.”

He just didn't want to fight.

Funny. Webber is the last one I expected to get cold feet.

“What are we lowest on?” Wilson asked, the question directed at me.

I thought for a moment. “FOOD, PROBABLY. AND FIREWOOD.”

“Firewood,” Webber immediately said. His whiskers were twitching slightly, and his brow was furrowed. I saw Wilson give the boy a strange look.

“YOU CANNOT FORGO KILLING FOREVER,” I warned him. “KILLING IS NECESSARY FOR OUR SURVIVAL.”

“WX, you wouldn't mind hunting, would you?” Wilson asked hopefully. “Why don't you bring Popsicle and Pyrite?”

A deep frown appeared on my face, I knew, but I couldn't stop it. Pyrite... the name they had given the Dragonfly hatchling. What a perfect name, I had remarked. Fool's gold, for a bunch of fools. Since her hatching the day before, she had done absolutely nothing but sleep. Occasionally she would wake up in order to find something to set on fire and eat, but that was the most we had seen from her.

Popsicle had apparently given himself the title of Protector of the Stupid Bug, and he refused to move from her side or even let us get too close.

I mentally cursed at myself for thinking of the creatures as anything other than that- creatures, that would one day undoubtedly become our food, if I could find a good time when both of the others' backs were turned.

I suddenly noticed that I was receiving just as harsh of a glare from the ice hound puppy. Did it understand Wilson, and hate the arrangement as much as I did? Of course not, I scoffed. A dog is no human; it can't even feel if it wanted to.

“YOU CAN'T PROTECT HIM,” I said instead, glancing deliberately down at Webber. “HUNTING IS IN HIS NATURE.”

“I can do what I like with him,” Wilson snapped. “The last time I checked, you weren't the one that all but adopted him.”

“Stop talking over me!” Webber barked. He pushed away from Wilson to stand between us, his fur standing on end. “I'm still here, you know! A spider takes a break for a few days and suddenly everyone pretends like he was never there in the first place! If you have something to say about us, you say it to us!” He shifted his narrowed gaze from me to Wilson and back. I couldn't help but let out the smallest sigh of relief. Good... he does still have a bite, even against Wilson.

But then I almost shivered. Me? I? A spider?

Who is talking to us right now?

The spider?

“We don't want to hunt, but we will if we have to, because that's survival. However, when there's three of us, all perfectly capable of hunting, we don't see why we would have to in the first place. Tame us all you want, but the facts will always come back to we are just as capable as either of you. There is nothing to protect.”

“Yes there is!” Wilson cried. “I've seen it now! We saw it yesterday!”

“Yesterday was an exception,” Webber protested, but I almost see the flush of embarrassment on his black-furred cheeks. “A moment of weakness does not make us weak.”

Wilson caught my gaze and I was surprised to see frustration in his. However, I could understand. Just when we think he's figured out, he does something like this.

Finally, the scientist let out a deep, exhausted sigh. “Would you still prefer to collect firewood?”

Webber nodded. “But that doesn't mean we can't hunt!” He added hastily with a small glare at me. I glowered back instinctively.

“Then you and I can go do that while WX can hunt.”

I opened my mouth, ready to protest. Webber was the best at hunting, and Wilson knew it. His speed was unmatched between us. In fact, I would even argue that I was the worst.

Wilson's trying to get him comfortable.

But why?

Wilson seemed to catch my expression and he waved it off. “Any of your shortcomings can easily be made up by Popsicle.”

“THEN WHY THE INSECT?” I decided to say, which took a great deal of self-restraint. Shortcomings!? My mind roared.

“To protect you if you're out too long. We don't want another attack now, do we?” He asked, tapping his ear. I covered the bolt that had been severed by the Night Monster and gave him the nastiest glare I could manage. “Come on, Webber.”

“WHAT IF YOU TWO ARE OUT TOO LONG?” I demanded, but I earned no response. Great, that left me in a conundrum. Either do what Wilson told me to- infuriating- or let ourselves starve. And, unfortunately, I couldn't really let that happen.

I motioned at the dog aggressively and started walking away without even checking to see if it was following me. Knowing the bug, it would follow right behind him.

…

As I walked, I was able to think. Particularly, about Wilson and Webber. I knew that my mind was better occupied with other things, but I felt like I needed to figure them out.

Something had happened with Wilson. Something that I couldn't quite answer, but something that could prove quite troublesome in the future at best, deadly at worst. It hadn't happened immediately after his reawakening; he seemed just fine the day before when he came back to us. Webber had seemed to immediately cling on him yesterday, but today, he seemed a bit off as well. Not off as in something happened to him, but he was clearly on edge about something. Did he sense what happened with Wilson?

I carefully turned over a few theories in my head. The obvious answer was that Wilson was not who came back to us. That was the idea I wanted to stick with, particularly so we could kill him and get the situation over with, but something told me it wouldn't be that simple. Besides, the person yesterday had certainly been Wilson, which means that the exchange would've happened some time between last night and this morning. But that wouldn't really make sense, either. What could want to pretend to be Wilson and why? I would think Maxwell, but he seemed to have no interest in directly causing our deaths and was far more amused by the idea of us running around like headless chickens. Plus, why Wilson? If he was an imposter, then he would lose his brain, which was the only thing that actually made him useful.

But that didn't mean...

Suddenly, it felt like a block of pure lead had dropped in my non-existent stomach. No, that was impossible, right?

Surely Wilson wasn't being possessed by something?

The more I thought about it, the more terrified I became.

There was a reason he wanted me to be separated from them.

He's going to do something to Webber.

The knowledge hit me like a brick and I came to a full stop. Despite myself, I could feel waves of terror pulsing through my circuits. One of them gone, I could deal with. If Wilson had to be eliminated or if Webber was killed, I would be able to get by just fine.

But if Webber was killed and all that I was left with was a possessed Wilson...

“COME ON, DOG!” I snapped. Immediately, Popsicle froze and stared at me. Pyrite bumped into him with a little trill, and a puff of steam appeared between them. “IF YOU CARE AT ALL ABOUT YOUR OWNER, YOU BOTH WILL FOLLOW ME.” Without checking- I didn't need to- I turned on my heel and sprinted as fast in the direction that they had gone.

I don't know what's going to happen tonight, but I'm going to stop it.

I'm coming. We followed Wilson, although confusion was starting to tinge our senses. We had long since left any forested area behind, and we were now walking through grassland. However, we still followed him, certain that he at least had a purpose for bringing us out there.

We jogged to catch up to him. “Wilson... um... what are we doing out here?”

We noticed that he pursed his lips and let out a low hum, but he didn't actually respond. His face was creased in an unrecognizable expression. What did that even mean? Did we do something to anger him? A wave of frustration flooded over us. Why couldn't he just tell us?

Finally fed up, we dug our feet into the ground and refused to move. Wilson almost immediately noticed that we were no longer following him and turned around, a scowl planted on his face. “What are you doing?”

“You won't tell us why we went out here.”

“To get wood,” he said as if we were the dumbest child he had ever encountered. It took all of our strength not to flinch back.

“If... if this is about yesterday, then you can just say that. We were emotional and transparent. That's not how we usually are. If you want to... pretend it never happened, then you can. You can go back to seeing me as the dumb, incompetent child you think we are.”

“This has nothing to do with yesterday,” Wilson snapped.

“Then what is the deal?”

“You'll know when we get there.”

“Get where!?” We knew that our voice was pitching with frustration, but he wasn't giving any answers.

Wilson only looked away. “It isn't far now.”

Our whiskers twitched. We knew we could take him if he attacked us. It would be that hard-

a sharp gasp escaped our throat as a length of something scratchy and thick wrapped around our throat and tightened. Immediately, terror washed away all of our senses, but we quickly realized that we could still breathe, albeit a bit uncomfortably. Wilson held the other end of the rope, glaring down at us while holding it high above his head. Our claws brushed over the knot he had formed. A noose...

“Where did you get this?” I hissed, afraid now of him tightening it. We hadn't seen it at all on the way here... he must have had it hidden, but already knotted.

“Doesn't matter. Now you have to follow me.” He pulled on the rope meaningfully, and it tightened ever so slightly in response. The smallest of whimpers escaped our throat. Whatever Wilson had planned for us, we had walked right into his trap and with no backup. We stumbled after him, a quicker pace now that he knew he couldn't lose us. We were unable to contain another whimper and we barely managed to swallow back the tears threatening to rise in our eyes. He had planned this all along, a voice whispered in the back of our head, but whether it was my own petrified conscience or Webber himself, I couldn't tell.

The ground started to become wetter, as if this particular area had experienced recent rainfall, but the trees around were completely dry. Awful, gurgling sounds came to our attention, as well as what sounded like distant growls or grumbles, and not from any spiders. We gripped the rope around our neck with all of our claws stretched out, trying to worry away at the material, but it didn't even look frayed no matter how much we clawed at it. This was much stronger than any ropes any of us had woven to get simple jobs done. This was a rope designed for something else.

Soon, the ground changed abruptly again to a hard, surprisingly clean marble. Wilson's shoes clicked against the flooring like a deadly clock, counting down to our inevitable maiming or worse. Our footsteps were much softer in comparison, both shoeless and muted by coarse fur, but to us, they were far too loud. Our heart was struggled to climb out of our throat and run, but somehow, it stayed put.

In the very center of the marble was what looked like a destroyed machine. It was made out of wood, but carved so finely that the wood it was built around would be fit for the dinner table of a king. The mud itself seemed to fear the machine, keeping a wide berth around it and creating a large spot of completely clean tile. The nearness to the machine immediately put us on edge, and we once again began to struggle.

This time, Wilson didn't even seem to notice the extra burden of our movements. He made his way straight for the machine and placed a hand on it, before withdrawing a long, perfectly carved knife made out of flint and wood. It was such a well-made weapon that, if we didn't know any better, we would've expected it to have come from Maxwell's calloused hands themselves.

He twirled the knife in his hand for a long moment before looking at us with a murderous glint. There was something deeply off about him now. His eyes, once gray and kind and caring, were now as hard as stone and betrayed nothing but his intent to use that knife on us. His body movements, his posture, it was all different. His grip on the rope loosened very slightly, something we tried to take advantage of, but a quick twist in order to make a break for it tore it free from his hand and opened it up to his foot.

He immediately stomped on the end, yanking us backward and tightening the rope even further. Now, we were struggling to breath. It pinched the skin around our throat and tore at the skin there, as well as obstructing our windpipe and forcing us to take small, quick breaths.

“What's going on?” I cried. I was able to notice that the spidery growl had completely fled it, leaving nothing but my own small, scared voice behind.

“After much deliberation, I have decided to accept a deal with someone,” Wilson said. He ran his finger along the back of the knife, never taking his cold eyes away from us. “A deal that scores the freedom of two of us. A deal that involves the sacrifice of the third.”

“Sacrifice?” I whimpered. It was the best I could manage. He intended to sacrifice me? To who? Why? What happened to Wilson?! Tears welled up in my eyes again, and I swallowed several times to keep them back. “Wilson... papa...”

“Shut it!” He snapped. “I hate to hear you beg.”

“I'm not begging, I just wanna know what happened to Wilson!”

I could barely register anything other than the pure, fierce heartbreak that was ravaging my insides. I could see his shoulders rising, but whether defensively or offensively, I couldn't tell, nor did I care to.

“The Wilson you thought you knew never existed!” He barked, his voice sharp and angry. “It has taken me a long time to gain your trust enough to bring you here. I mean, really, have you looked at yourself? No self-respecting creature would dare call you their own, human and spider alike.”

My heart was torn to shreds. I could barely breathe, but now it wasn't even just because of the rope. I could feel my chest heaving with sobs that I only barely managed to swallow back before they could fall down my cheek.

“No wonder someone as young as you is out here. Your parents must have thrown you out as soon as they saw you.”

I couldn't help it now. It was all I could do to cover my eyes to hide the first tears that wetted my fur.

“All that matters to me- all that ever mattered to me- is escaping. I want to leave this godforsaken land behind, and all of its creatures.” I almost didn't register the way his eyes narrowed at me as he said that- he was referring to me. “Saving WX is a bonus, one that I didn't expect.” He waved his hand as if it was a trivial subject. “But I always knew you would be useful to keep around. Useful to keep around and to soften so much that he can barely stand up for himself, even when he's being actively attacked.”

He was right. If I was who I was when we first met- was that almost a year ago?- I would have easily torn out of my restraints and fled as far as I could, probably taking Wilson's life with me. Now, I wasn't even sure my legs could hold me up long enough to stand, let alone to fight or run.

And not Wilson. Especially not Wilson.

“Th-this isn't y-you,” I sputtered, choking back another fresh wave of tears. “Wilson wouldn't d-do this! You're lying!”

He finally seemed to notice the change in my voice, or something of the like, because his mouth turned upwards in a sneer. “Even Webber abandoned you. I guess that means I'm talking to no one but Tyler, aren't I?”

“D-Don't use that n-name.” My voice was so small, yet it took all of my energy to speak. The sheer amount of effort it was taking to not fall apart before his very eyes was killing me far faster than any wound could.

“Why not? Does it bring back too many painful memories?” He jeered.

“Wilson... Wilson can use that name. Not you...”

He let out a frustrated roar and lashed out with the knife. Immediately, a line of fire seared across my face, just barely missing one of my eyes. Against my will, a cry of pain erupted from my chest and I fell back. I felt Wilson's weight shift away from the rope, but before I could even attempt to stand he grabbed the loop that was around my neck and pulled at it, pulling me up with it.

Now, our faces were only inches apart. The person I was looking at... there was no way it was Wilson. This was not the same person that had let me call him my father only a day before.

“Please,” I whispered.

He let out a sort of scoff before dragging me towards the machine. My muscles locked with terror. Even if I had the energy to run, I just couldn't...

But then his head turned, as if he had heard something. The second his gaze left mine, I struggled free and tried to run, but before I could even get my footing I was being dragged back. This time, Wilson's eyes were alight with fire. “How dare you!?” He snarled. “There will be no escape!” To punctuate his words, the knife came back at me, but it didn't go for my face. Instead, white-hot agony seared through my entire arm as he pinned me by my hand. My first thought was that it was a stab wound, that there was no way it was any worse, but when I finally managed to tear my gaze away from him, I could see that the knife had been thrust straight through my hand and out the other side before burying solidly in the wood. I was completely pinned in place.

The terror I felt previously exploded into utter panic. I gripped the handle of the knife and struggled to pull it free, but my already-diminished strength was quickly failing me. Blood pulsed out of the wound, hard and fast to the pounding of my heart. A moment later, a blade was biting into my neck, smoothly sliding through skin and sinew until blood poured from it as furiously as from my hand. A keen, wailing sound developed in my throat, but I couldn't do anything else.

My awareness shifted to the fact that Wilson had vanished only long enough before it was slammed back into the pain.

I had felt pain before- quite often, in fact. But there was nothing, absolutely nothing, that could possibly compare to this.

I gasped desperately for air, the noose around my neck preventing me from getting more than the smallest breath at a time. My vision was quickly turning black, but whether I was going to pass out from blood loss or from my inability to breathe was both unknown and unimportant.

I couldn't pass out. There was a lot of things that shouldn't happen, that would only make this worse, but I prayed to any force looking down on me to keep me awake.

I heard voices, but I didn't know who they belonged to. Raised, angry voices, belonging to people that I should recognize. Unfortunately, whoever had come had come far too late. I didn't need to be a medical expert to know I was only seconds away from going into full-blown shock. I was going to die here, far from my family and alone.

I had to stay awake. I couldn't let myself fall into shock, I couldn't pass out. The thoughts paced in my mind in a sluggish circle, so different from the speed of my racing heart and aching lungs.

Those thoughts, the ones attempting to prevent this very thing, followed me as my vision went black, and my muscles fell limp. I knew immediately that I was too late.

Popsicle, despite being a puppy, was called a hound for a reason, and was easily able to find the trail of his owner. However, it was much slower moving than I would have liked. Pyrite slowed us down as well, since it took half of my effort to keep her from setting anything on fire. Literally anything could be happening right now. For all I knew, Webber was perfectly fine and all of this was just my mind finally snapping under the pressure. Yet somewhere, deep inside, I knew that my presence would mean life or death to the boy.

I heard them before I found them. Well... more like I heard Webber. It wasn't until I was closer that I was able to hear Wilson's low, angry, and quick speaking, but what I had heard from Webber was a kind of pain I had never inflicted nor seen inflicted on him. It was a cry of pain, but overflowing with so much heartbreak it would be impossible for even the most callous of individuals to ignore.

“WILSON!” I called out, unable to keep the rage out of my voice. A moment passed before there was another pained cry, though this one was more of a screech. It carried despite the muddy bog and bore directly into my chest. I closed my fists around my spear, which may or may not have been hastily crafted into a halberd at some point, and pushed through the mud until I was able to find solid ground.

That solid ground happened to be marble. For me, that meant it was completely impossible for any kind of sneak attack. A human would cause a ruckus walking on such well-kept tile, someone of my composition and weight would be deafening.

Which is why I wasn't surprised to see Wilson already waiting for me in the center. There was a large wooden object that he was next to, but my eyes immediately skipped over it in favor of staring at the boy who had been pinned against it. I had to physically tear my gaze away from him in order to rest it on Wilson.

The scientist had been staring steadily at me as if gauging my reaction. Upon seeing what must have been the most raw, unfiltered rage he had ever seen, I saw his eyes narrow. Fine. He wasn't going to back down. At least I wouldn't feel bad about killing him again.

“Make your choice now, WX,” Wilson said before I could even get close to him. He flashed a weapon at me, and it surprised me to realize that it was the top half of his morning star that had been destroyed when we fought the dragonfly. Except now, it looked much closer to a mace in size. There was no way he snuck that out of camp.

Because he didn't, my mind supplied glumly. Because it was waiting here for him.

“CHOICE?” I was deeply surprised by how tight my voice was. I almost saw the scientist falter under the sound of it. It took me a moment to control it, before attempting to speak again. “YOU ARE RIGHT. THERE WAS A CHOICE. AND YOU MADE THE WRONG ONE.”

He brandished the weapon again, although this time in a more battle-ready stance rather than just showing that he had it. “A choice to free us both,” he snapped. “You never heard what the plan was, WX. It was going to end with us finally free to go home.”

“AND HOW WAS IT GOING TO END WITH WEBBER?”

He shrugged and motioned at the wooden machine. “The way it's ending now.”

That did it. Before I could even think out my next action, my spear was colliding with his morning star. I could immediately tell that his weapon was the stronger of the two, if not the heavier, but the opposite was true for us.

Disarming him was easier than it should have been, though that should have been a given since his weapon was far from properly weighed for something of its current size. It was designed to be held as a long weapon, and shortening the handle did not make an equally competent but shorter weapon. No longer than a few seconds after engaging him, he was at the mercy of my halberd. He bared his teeth at me as if he were some sort of animal. “Do it then. Kill me.”

“Don't.” The voice was so tiny that I would not have noticed it if it weren't for the complete silence otherwise. I turned my head in disbelief, meeting Webber's gaze. His white eyes were completely glazed over with pain, and I could see him wheezing from here, but he was staring at Wilson. “Don't- kill him. Not him...”

I stared at Webber for only half a second before sensing Wilson's movement again. I grabbed his fist as it came and used it to push him back, if only slightly. “I WILL NOT KILL YOU. NOT YET. I WILL KILL YOU WHEN HE SAYS SO.” Wilson's eyes narrowed, but before he could say anything or retort at all, my other fist came down hard and fast on his elbow, bending it the wrong way with a definite crack! of snapping bone.

I could immediately see surprise and agony wash over his expression, but as soon as I dropped his arm, my aim was for his face.

The second my punch landed, he crumpled. Blood welled up under his nose, and I could see his chest rising and falling with his breaths, but he was completely incapacitated... for now.

Which gave me time to turn my attention to Webber.

He was slipping in and out of consciousness, but I couldn't help but feel relieved that it didn't seem as if he had gone into shock.

Yet.

I crouched down to his level, examining his face. His fur was damp with sweat and his chest was moving rapidly up and down, but I could hear him wheezing loudly. There was a rope around his neck, tied much like a noose, that was painted red with the amount of blood pooling from his neck. Luckily, it seemed Wilson had not cut his carotid artery given it was a steady flow rather than a hissing stream of blood.

The worst of it was definitely what had happened to his hand. It was his left hand, which I knew by experience was his dominant one. He was slumped against the wooden machine awkwardly, the pinned hand held high above his head. At least it's above his heart, I thought. That will slow the blood flow a bit.

I glance behind me to make sure Wilson was still unconscious before turning all of my attention to the knife. I couldn't imagine the strength it had taken to stab the knife straight through. “SORRY,” I murmured before taking a hold of the grip of the weapon. I braced myself for a moment, then yanked it free with all of my strength.

Webber let out another heartrending cry as he crumpled under the weight of his own body. I caught him before he could hit the ground. He was a complete deadweight in my arms, his fur unnaturally warm with a fever already setting in. I hesitated for a long moment, simply staring helplessly at the unconscious boy in my arms. I may have stopped any immediate threat, but the truth was, there was still a very real chance of dying if I didn't staunch the blood flow and keep the wounds clean.

I stood, still holding Webber in my arms, and stared at Wilson. Webber hadn't wanted me to kill him, and he was in no condition for me to ignore his wishes. And yet, this was so deliberate, so precise, that it terrified me. Had something really possessed Wilson? How were we going to get him back, if so?

Webber let out the smallest of whimpers, which forced my attention back to him. Wilson could wait until later. The first thing I had to do was staunch the blood flow.

We didn't have anything for a wound like this. Grass, maybe, but that would definitely cause infection to set in...

There had been someone who had helped Webber before. Someone who had bound and healed his wound without question, and had done it so efficiently it had barely scarred.

“HOLD ON, WEBBER,” I murmured. “WE'RE GOING TO FIND ERIKA.” I awoke to what was probably the worst pain I have ever felt in my life.

My head was pounding in an intense migraine, and without looking I could tell that my nose was swollen and crusted with blood. When I attempted to drag myself to my hands and feet, a lightning bolt of pain shot through my arm and I found myself collapsing. Unable to do much else, I let out a low groan.

I was alone and someplace I had never seen before. The hard, cold ground beneath me only drastically increased the ache that I felt all over. The pain seemed to radiate deep into my chest, so much so that even my heart and lungs felt torn to shreds.

Using my good arm, I slowly pulled myself back up, using some sort of circular wooden machine to get my balance again. After I was standing, I dared to look at my injured arm, only looking away quickly a moment later as a wave of dizziness passed over me. My fingers were cold to the touch, but that was the least of my worries. The entire arm was swollen painfully and beginning to turn purple.

What... happened to me?

It took me a few moments before I decided that I was going to be able to stand with support. Even then, my head swam and the world tipped around me. I leaned up against the machine again, holding my head and trying to keep from passing out.

“OH, SO NOW YOU ARE AWAKE.”

The voice caught me so off guard that I jumped, but something hard and sharp brushed against my neck as I did so. I opened my eyes again to see a spear held up to my throat, barely an inch away.

“What's the big idea!?” I cried, attempting to swipe the weapon away before realizing that it was my injured arm that tried to complete the action. I cradled it to my chest, hissing in pain.

“I SHOULD BE ASKING YOU.”

WX thrust the weapon even closer to me. Now, the sharp edge was digging into my chin, forcing my head upward with the only other option being impaled. My voice pitched with fear: “What did you do to me?” I cried. “Where did you take me!?”
WX's hold on the weapon faltered a bit, but a moment later he shot the weapon forward, slicing what likely was a formidable gash across my cheek. I cried out in shock. “WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!” He hissed. His limbs were stiff with anger, and even a deaf person would've heard the way his voice shook with unrestrained rage. “I SHOULD KILL YOU RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE LUCKY HE'S STICKING UP FOR YOU.”

“I don't know what you're talking about!” My voice broke into what could only be described as a squeak. “Clearly there's some misunderstanding.”

“CLEARLY THERE ISN'T.” He motioned to my broken arm.

“You did this to me?” My fear was beginning to be replaced with anger. How dare WX injure me like this? And where was-?

I felt my heart drop into the pit of my stomach.

“What did you do to Webber?”

The blow was immediate. One second, the spear was at my throat, the next I was reeling back with a fresh gush of blood from my already likely broken nose. I could feel myself shaking with agony now, waves of pain staining my senses until I could barely concentrate on WX in front of me. It was all I could do to stay upright, even with all of my weight on the wooden machine. A second later, another punch to the gut followed it. This was the one that sent me sprawling onto the ground, coughing heavily. I held my good arm around my stomach, trying to keep from retching from the sudden trauma. Before I could recover, a cold hand grabbed the collar of my shirt and yanked me up until our faces were less than an inch away from each other.

“I COULD KEEP GOING,” he hissed. “YOU DESERVE WHATEVER I DO TO YOU HERE. YOUR ACTIONS WILL FOLLOW YOU TO THE GRAVE.”

“I-I don't understand,” I sputtered. My actions? It appeared to me like I was the one being assaulted!

WX let out a yell of frustration before throwing me back on to the ground. A moment later, his foot planted into my chest and held me there. He was far from pressing all of his weight into me, but I could already feel my ribs groaning under the pressure. “YOU WILL TELL ME,” he snarled. He leaned forward until my breaths were nothing more than sharp gasps. “WHO. YOU. CONTACTED.”

“I-I can't- I can't.” I tried desperately to push his foot off of me. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't breathe.

He let out a hiss of disgust, but the pressure suddenly left. I shot up and coughed loudly, swallowing as much air as I could. “I didn't- nobody-”

His eyes were pits of rage, and his fists were clenching and relaxing as if he was holding back. “YOU'RE FEIGNING STUPIDITY.”

“Where's Webber!?” I cried. He had done something, hadn't he? And now, I was next?

“...FINE.” Immediately, WX grabbed my injured arm in a death grip and yanked me up. I choked out a sob, shaking in pain once more. He scoffed, but released it and instead grabbed the same shoulder. I had no hope of getting free from him, even if I wanted to. His fingers dug into my flesh, and I was sure that that spot was going to be bleeding soon as well. With no other option but coming with him, I chewed on my lip and stumbled along.

…

Before we even got back to base, I heard unfamiliar noises. Hissing. Spiders.

I glanced at WX, who was deliberately keep his gaze straight ahead. I opened my mouth to ask, or to guess, but the sight of camp left my mouth half-open with nothing coming out of it.

There were a couple of spiders there, a species that must have been completely different from whatever Webber was. One of them, the one who seemed to be snapping orders to the other, was a fluffy white one. As soon as its strangely pink eyes landed on me, its teeth bared in a snarl. Its companion immediately turned as well, this one dark blue in color with fur that looked as if it had been pulled through thorns. Before I could have both of them at my throat, though, WX sharply snapped at them and they both turned back to...

Webber.

“LOOK AT HIM,” WX snarled at me. “LOOK AT YOUR HANDYWORK. ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF FOR NEARLY KILLING A CHILD? ONE THAT TRUSTED YOU WITH HIS LIFE?” I opened my mouth to respond, but he interrupted me before I could. His hand wrapped around the back of my neck and he forced my closer, and forced my face in the direction of the injured boy. “ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF!?” His voice had risen to a yell. As he said this, he threw me aside again. His fists were clenched and shaking furiously. “GO AHEAD AND FINISH THE JOB! I DARE YOU.”

WX was shorter than me, yes, but he seemed to tower over me in that very moment.

“You're... saying I did that to him?” My voice was so tiny I would've been surprised if he heard it.

He raised his fist again as if to strike me once more, but even as I was flinching away the white spider was snarling at him, and he dropped it. “GO AWAY, IF YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOU.”

“Let me help!” I exclaimed shakily. “I promise! I didn't do that to him! I wouldn't hurt anyone like that. Especially not... especially not Webber.”

“YOU ARE LUCKY THAT YOU ARE MY SECOND PRIORITY,” he snapped. He turned his back to me in order to crouch in front of Webber. The dark blue spider, a spitter, if I could remember correctly, was wrapping layers of silk around the boy's hand, but blood was soaking through it faster than it could work.

The white one, which I believed was called a dangling depths dweller was nervously pacing back and forth, looking very much like it was mumbling to itself.

“IT TOOK US HOURS TO STABILIZE HIM,” WX said, his voice strangely soft. Maybe the outburst had taken it all out of him. “AND WE STILL CAN'T GET HIS HAND TO STOP BLEEDING.” He fell silent for a moment, staring down. “WHY DID YOU DO IT? I JUST... I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. WILSON, WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN?”

“WX,” I pleaded. “I swear, I don't know who did his. I wouldn't- I couldn't-” the thought of doing something like that to any child, let alone Webber, destroyed me inside. I finally managed to catch his gaze, attempting to pour as much emotion I could into my expression. “I would never hurt Webber.”

“THEN TAKE A LOOK AT HIS WOUNDS YOURSELF!” He snapped. “TELL ME THAT IS NOT THE CUT OF YOUR BLADE. THE CUT OF YOUR KNIFE.”

“You have to believe me, please...”

I saw his fist clench again, and he closed his eyes tightly. When he spoke, his voice was cold. “WHATEVER HAPPENS TO HIM, YOU WILL FOLLOW THE SAME FATE.”

The meaning was obvious: if Webber didn't survive, neither would I.

“IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR ARM, IT WILL NEVER HEAL PROPERLY.” He turned his gaze away from me again. He wanted me to leave him alone. I nodded slowly, staring at the ground. The past day... it was nothing but fog. Was it true that I had done something like this? If that's true... I'll never forgive myself.

I surveyed the camp, trying to ignore how ravaged it appeared. There must have really been a struggle if WX had allowed such a mess without cleaning it up. As I turned around, though, I heard a small scuffle, and a spiderlike snarl followed by a tiny voice seemingly repeating the same thing. “...Wilson?”

Webber's eyes had flickered open, although they were glazed with pain and I wasn't even sure if he was looking at me. I tried to take a step towards him, but WX's gaze immediately snapped to me, and the two spiders bristled. Instead, I crouched down a few feet away from him.

“Wilson...!” His voice rose in relief and joy, but when he tried to move, the white spider immediately growled at him. He hissed something back at it, and it stepped back, its gaze weary. “It's... you're back...!” His voice was weak and rough, as was the purr that followed. I couldn't help but wince. If I had done something like this to him, then why would be acting like this?

WX seemed to have the same question. “HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ALREADY THAT YOU ARE LIKE THIS BECAUSE OF HIM!?” He snapped. When Webber tried to move again, the robot grabbed his shoulder and held him in place. “YOU NEARLY DIED AT HIS HAND!”

Webber's eyes unfocused, and his smile dropped slightly. He shook his head. “It... couldn't be... not him...”

He trusts me, relief washed over me, so intensely that I nearly fell over. WX and the spiders both seemed pretty convinced that I had hurt Webber, but the boy himself still trusted me.

I looked down at my hands. There was blood on them.

The blank on my memory... had I actually done something to Webber?

I couldn't have... I couldn't... I wouldn't...

I reached out my hand to him, but before he could take it, the white spider got between us again, hissing. I drew back with a frown on my face, then turned my gaze back to Webber. He seemed to have fallen back out of consciousness. Good. Well, not good. If he couldn't stay conscious, that probably meant he was very nastily hurt, but at least he was getting rest. I could see a wound on his neck that had been patched up with silk, and another across his face that had stopped bleeding without it. What really concerned me was his hand. A substantial pile of bloody silk lay strewn around the dark blue spider, but it had only now just managed to staunch the bleeding.

Trying to ignore the pain in my belly, I glanced at WX. “...Who are the spiders?”

“FRIENDS OF HIS,” the robot replied. “THEY HEALED HIM WELL THE LAST TIME HE GOT INJURED.” I caught a side-glare from him, but tried to ignore it. “I WAS NEARLY EVISCERATED BY THE BEASTS UNTIL THEY REALIZED I WAS TRYING TO HELP HIM.”

“I didn't expect to see cave spiders up here.”

“THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE UP HERE.” He left the conversation at that.

An awkward silence fell over us. I could feel the barely restrained anger emanating from my robotic companion, but he didn't seem to make any moves towards me. I moved to scratch my head, but winced painfully as I remembered the arm. Well, okay, he probably did enough to me to keep me occupied for awhile.

I turned away from the boy, turning to the items scattered all over camp. That was... probably going to be a pain to clean up. I shrugged very slightly before settling down to fashion a sling for my arm and fasten something to help my nose heal properly.

After several minutes, WX came up beside me. His face was a deep frown, but I couldn't tell if it was directed at me or the situation. “...HE SHOULD BE FINE,” the robot said heavily. “NO THANKS TO YOU.”

“WX...” even I was surprised at the tightness of my voice. I moved my good arm to rub my eyes, and was surprised to feel an irritating wetness there. “...what happened? It's... it's all just a blur. I-” My gaze, unwillingly, shifted back to the injured boy. The spitter was now asleep a few feet away from Webber, whereas the dangling depths dweller was pacing back and forth in front of him, twitching. “I never would've hurt him.” Several tears followed the words and I looked down, focused on the hand that wasn't bound up in a sling. I clenched my fist and squeezed my eyes shut for a moment before looking back at WX. “Please... you have to believe me. Especially now... I wouldn't have hurt him when we had no more bond than a common goal.” I choked on my words. Was I a monster? I denied it, I refused to believe it, but I could recognize the look of my own knife wounds. Nobody else could have done that. “The bond we share... that we all share... it's so much deeper than that. Please...! I couldn't- I could never-” I couldn't say anything else. It was taking all of my effort to breathe, let alone speak. Some part of my mind was chastising my weakness: you are a grown man! Men don't cry, let alone sob! But I couldn't help it. The idea, the very implication of what had happened to Webber: what I had done to Webber.

I did not expect any comfort from the robot, and did not receive any. He simply stared at me, his gaze turned into a deep, wordless frown.

I didn't give myself time to fully recover. I was still gasping for breath between sobs when words started pouring out of my mouth. “I- I had a terrible nightmare and it wanted me to do something terrible but I couldn't- I couldn't...! But no matter how hard I fought it, it was w-winning and now it's u-using me and I don't know how to free myself. I never wanted to hurt Webber. I never wanted to hurt you! When I woke up I was so c-confused but the longer I see him and the longer I think about it I can't- I can't deny it. But I can't control it! Whatever it is it's inside of me and it's so, so angry and I can't get it out and I don't know what to do. It's all just darkness and fog and now Webber is on death's door and I wasn't even around to help him...”

“THE MORE YOU SPEAK, THE MORE YOU EMBARRASS YOURSELF.” He didn't sound as hostile as I expected. It was all but a confession of guilt. He was silent for a moment before standing, still refusing to acknowledge my whimpering cries and shaking sobs. “POSSESSION- I WILL ADMIT THAT IT CROSSED MY MIND. YOU HAVE CONVINCED ME, WILSON. WHAT YOU HAVE NOT DONE IS SAID HOW YOU ARE GOING TO FIX IT.”

I placed a hand on my chest, blinking away tears. I could feel something inside of my heart. It... I felt so cold.

“I don't know,” I whispered. The first, and admittedly only, idea that came to mind was to kill me again. There was something that the monster... Nightmare... had said. That they wanted Webber to make up for losing me. I had offered myself then, but the idea of offering my life to WX was enough to force the darkness in my heart to twist, and the ice radiated out to my fingertips.

I knew that, if I told him now, that killing me would fix this, he would.

It was abundantly clear, in that moment, that WX constantly chastised me for trying to protect Webber, but when it came down to it, WX would defend Webber until the last spark of life left his robotic form.

Webber may have viewed me in a more... parental sense, but WX was the true protector of the boy now.

When WX didn't say anything, I could feel myself shaking again. I was already tired of shaking and cowering away, but I couldn't stop it. “WX, please, I really don't know...”

He shook his head, never taking that eyeless gaze away from me.

“HE TRUSTS YOU,” he said after a long, long moment. “HE KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. I SUSPECT THAT IF THIS PASSES WITHOUT ANY MORE PROBLEMS... HE WILL FORGET IT EVER HAPPENED.” I winced. His hand sure wouldn't. “HOWEVER... I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME MERCY WOULD BE GRANTED IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN.”

I nodded ever so slightly. I sniffled and rubbed my eyes. “I don't even deserve the second chance.”

“IF IT WERE UP TO ME, YOU WOULD BE DEAD.” He frowned for a moment, wringing his hands together. “...I GRIEVED FOR YOU, WILSON. IT WAS HARDLY A WEEK THAT YOU WERE GONE, BUT I STILL RETURNED TO THAT BATTLEGROUND SO MANY TIMES.” His gaze turned serious. “BUT I WILL NOT SPARE YOU IF IT COMES DOWN TO A FIGHT.”

“I know.”

He nodded, just once, before returning to his watchful vigil.

I sighed. Something was eating away at me, and I couldn't stop it. Maybe... maybe it would be better if I left them. Went as far as I possibly could and just give myself up to the wilderness. Maybe, if they had my soul, they would leave Webber alone.

But right now... I couldn't bare the idea. I couldn't be alone, not again. And so, instead, I sighed and turned to the fire. WX was probably getting hungry, if he wasn't already, and Webber would certainly need something to eat once he woke up properly. That was probably the best thing I could do right now, even if it would be harder with a broken arm.

I didn't even notice as my hand idly slipped a white-skinned vegetable into the food. We found ourselves on a knife's edge between sleep and wakefulness. The sleep was light enough for us to hear some of the conversations around us, but we weren't able to stay awake for longer than a few moments at a time.

The first time we had opened our eyes, we were somewhere dark. The air had been heavy and thick with the scent of mildew, and it had made breathing even more difficult than it was before. Cold arms had been holding us, carrying us...

The next time, we were back on the surface, and a duo of spiders looked on. One, I didn't recognize, but the other had struck me so deep that I couldn't help but murmur her name in surprise. Erika had said something to us, using a name we had never expected to hear from her, but we had slipped back into darkness only a second later.

The third time, Wilson's gray eyes had been focused on us. He turned away for only a moment until we managed to say his name aloud, first in a spiderlike hiss and secondly in English. It had been him, as he really was. His eyes were torn, his entire body shaking intensely with either fear, pain, or grief. It was that moment that we knew that the person who had attacked us wasn't him.

The fourth time, we were completely encased in darkness. We were slightly more awake this time, awake enough to notice the thin blood crusted across our face, the silk that had been gently wrapped around our neck, and the significantly thicker and stiffer bandages around our hand. Our hand...

Pinned against a machine, listening to Wilson's mad ravings.

We instinctively shivered and tried to cower, but we couldn't. The fact that we were completely swallowed by darkness had not quite occurred to us yet, nor did the uncomfortable sensation of being slung over someone's shoulder.

Immediately, we sucked in a breath of air and struggled, but before we could even try to move, we were thrown roughly onto the cold, hard ground. The impact sent shockwaves through our body, choking another whimper from deep within us. Wilson- whatever, whoever was doing this to him- was going to finish the job WX had interrupted the night before. Where's WX? Our mind cried, immediately shying away from what we figured was the most obvious answer. He was letting this happen.

We tried to cry out, to yell for help, but we nearly choked on a swathe of something... some sort of fabric? Silk? That had been formed into a gag. We tried to ignore the spike of panic, forcing ourselves to think of one thing at a time.

Get rid of the gag. That wouldn't be hard. The material seemed surprisingly flimsy and our fangs seemed to be able to cut through it just fine.

Unfortunately, he seemed to notice that we were awake.

“Surprising,” Wilson muttered. “I would've thought you would've been out for much longer. Hmm... perhaps I need to adjust the dose next time.”

A final, solid twist of our jaw, and the binding fell apart. We took a few gasping breaths, trying to prepare ourselves for whatever was coming next. The last time, it had been out of a sheer unwillingness to harm Wilson to stop us from fighting back.

This time, we physically couldn't.

We tried to say something, to try to get through to him, but before we could, his fist crashed into the broken wooden machine. “Why do you have to be so useless!?” He shouted, gritting his teeth. The change was so abrupt, so similar to last night, that we immediately began to shake. We tried to move backwards, but the machine was to our back and our bandaged hand didn't allow for much use. Even the slightest touch of it against the ground sent pulsing waves of agony all through our arm. “Even when you're only purpose is to die, you can't even do that!” His gray eyes snapped towards where we were. “The Master would be disappointed in me if I let anything be half-done. And I'm not taking another chance with you.” His fists clenched again as he pressed them both into the wood, his glare never leaving me. “I was told to kill you all those years ago, before you were consumed. The only reason I didn't was because of the potential I saw in you. Clearly, that potential was nothing more than to be a pain in my neck!”

I couldn't move. I so desperately needed to, to get away, to find help, whether it be from WX or from the spiders, but I couldn't move. All of my limbs, spider or otherwise, were locked in place, and it was all I could do to stare at him and take what he was saying.

“Then, I thought that feeding you to the spiders would be enough. After all, your sister perished exactly as planned with no intervention. But then you refused!”

His hand whipped out and held my throat, pinning me against the ground with nothing but his weight. I had fought WX before, and Wilson's weight was nothing compared to that, but it was nothing I could shake off at my peak, let alone injured and drugged. Last time, he had a noose around my neck which troubled my breathing, but this was more extreme. I couldn't breathe at all.

I tried desperately to suck in breaths, but nothing could get through. Panic forced my heart to pound, which in turned made my body beg for more oxygen.

It finally seemed like one of my sporadic movements landed a hit on his gut, which he immediately recoiled from, enough for me to be freed from his hold. I tried to call out again, but air was rasping against my throat so hard that all I could manage was a low hiss of air.

His hand gripped my scruff, not quite freezing me in place but it was a grip that I couldn't afford to have. Before I could struggle out of it, the hand was around my throat again, this time before I was promptly slammed against the wooden machine. The dawn light was glowing behind him now, casing a heavy shade over his face. It highlighted his clearly broken arm and how he ignored it in favor of having a better grip on me.

Erika was so close and I never got to know her as my sister again-

Holding me tightly with one hand, his other hand had pulled out a knife, which glinted in the early sun. He ran his thumb across the dull side, his eyes flickering between different parts of my face, considering where to cut, where to dissect me like an animal.

I hope WX will be okay and that he's able to be freed-

The sharp end of the knife rested, almost gently, directly above one of my accessory eyes.

I grabbed at him, pushed at him, struggled as hard as I could, but he never once even reacted like I was moving. His voice was so low that I could barely recognize it as his own. “Even if they save you now, you will never be able to fend for yourself again.”

I hope-

The knife was pressed down, slicing open skin and obliterating the useless eye as it went.

I hope-

My body felt the wound before my mind caught up. The hand on my throat meant I couldn't scream, but my vision immediately began to get swallowed up by black and red, and my legs kicked out on reflex.

I hope Wilson gets better.

The knife passed cleanly, effortlessly, through my eye.

Immediately, fluid followed behind. Blood and tears poured down and soaked my cheek, but the knife cut down until the eye was completely split in half.

Then, and only then, did Wilson withdraw to gaze upon his handiwork.

The second he dropped me, I felt my body heave in a retch. I barely registered as the scientist took a step back. Even after I had lost everything I had in my stomach, I couldn't stop shaking. I collapsed sideways, desperately trying to look up at Wilson through the spots in my vision. The hands were gone but I still couldn't breath and I couldn't see anything out of my right eye and I was alone and- and- and-

His head snapped to the side, a look of shock passing over his gaze before being quickly swallowed by anger. He discarded his knife in favor of his morning star and immediately pressed the weapon into my injured hand. “Take one more step and he loses it!” He roared.

Everything was pulsing in and out of existence. My mind lamely murmured: looks like WX is here...

But it wasn't him.

In fact, I was able to make out a blur of blue fur and the snarl of a hound puppy. Popsicle, no!

I couldn't help him, though. I couldn't move if I wanted to, and it had nothing to do with the mace slowly grinding the bones of my injured hand. I couldn't feel it at all- it was as if every nerve in my body was in full-blown panic mode, desperately trying to recover from the loss of an eye.

The pressure on my hand lifted, just as the ice hound lunged towards the scientist.

We had taken out dozens of hounds, both individually and together. One tiny puppy would be no match for him.

As Wilson was raising his weapon for a single, quick killing blow, he suddenly stiffened, his eyes widening in shock. Another moment later and he pitched to the side.

WX stood behind him, blinking intensely. He still had one hand up and a knife in his other hand. I wanted to say something, to acknowledge the rescue, but nothing would come out. I was drifting again, but this time I let myself.

I sensed more than saw the robot crouch beside me, murmuring something surprisingly quiet. A moment later, he continued to speak, though this time, it was in a warmer voice.

He...

He was singing.

He was singing a lullaby.

I knew I was safe, in that moment. It was a lullaby I hadn't heard since I was small, one that had always calmed me down from the worst of fits and always put me at ease even with the worst of stress.

And so... I let my body relax and let my remaining eye drift close into a hazy, miserable sleep. She stood alone in a room filled with orbs.

Her dress slid on the floor behind her as she walked, her bare feet making small patters against the marble, her delicate hands reaching out to brush against the glowing orbs that surrounded her.

This was a place that only very particular... demons, she supposed, could enter. At this moment in time, only Charlie and her lesser half could slip into this world-between-worlds and read the source code of the world. Her face creased in the smallest of frowns as she turned her eyes to the edges of the room.

The edges were beginning to unravel, almost like threads that had been tugged at far too much.

Things weren't looking good. She normally had some control over events that transpired in the Constant, but humans were beyond her power. She could only watch helplessly as they wandered around for a few months before dying of starvation or falling prey to one of the many massive hound packs. So... she tried to stay away from meddling in their affairs, even if it wasn't always possible.

Her other half, however, was not the kind to stay out of things.

She let out a small, pained sigh. Together, her and Nightmare had brought the scientist back from death, a small victory in what eventually became a tragedy.

Her hand rested on an orb, voices coming to her ears as she did so. “Then, I thought that feeding you to the spiders would be enough! After all, your sister perished exactly as planned with no intervention. But then you refused!”

“I thought you could finally do it,” Charlie whispered. She paced forward slightly in order to move to another orb. The boy was still alive, and she had a feeling that this would not be his end, but the agony he suffered was enough to tear at her heart. The robot hadn't left his side for days, nor had his arachnid companions. Nightmare had done this, and she wasn't too stupid to know that. She just... couldn't do anything about it.

But this latest attempt... Nightmare had been very angered by it's failure. Perhaps it knew that she had stopped anything worse from happening... perhaps it knew that she was trying to help them.

Charlie finally made her way to the far side of the room, where some of the orbs had been caught in the unraveling seams. In there, her eyes grazed over bloodstained memories that she preferred to forget. The horrifying murder of a prime ape's innocent mate at Nightmare's hand, the rejection of his daughter followed by the quick degradation of his sanity. Charlie hadn't been able to save any of them, and she had tried so hard. What made her think she could save these survivors?

Her heart twisted in her chest. It was days like this that made her wish that her sister was here. She always knew what to do and how to do it... if anyone could save them, it would be her.

Charlie growled to herself, shaking her head. As she did so, she heard an earthshattering crash. Immediately, her mind pulsed with an event that had been erased from everyone's memories but their own: the Prime Ape princess attacking her father and leaving him for dead. If any event had to be forgotten, at least it was one better erased.

Nightmare swooped in like a furious tsunami. Nightmare was a curious beast, always taking the appearance of whatever unfortunate soul had the burden of carrying it. In its current form, it looked much like Charlie herself, except if Charlie had been crafted out of red smoke and black shadows. Its eyes were blank, and fire burned at its hands as it glared down at the shattered remains of an orb.

“Nightmare,” she greeted coldly.

The beast didn't look up for a long moment, its shoulders heaving with... rage? Probably rage. When it did look up, it took all of Charlie's strength not to flinch.

“How. Did. He. Hold back?” The demon snarled, enunciating every single syllable as if Charlie wouldn't be able to understand it otherwise. She struggled to push back the relief and glee that was threatening to cover her face. One person holding back Nightmare was nothing: the beast was something created by the world, tied to the world, and stronger than anything else in it. It could easily overcome anyone, especially a weak scientist with an even weaker will.

But if, say, Charlie assisted said scientist in fighting the demon back... Nightmare was not able to complete its task.

“I do not know,” she lied smoothly. It was easy for Charlie to lie, now. Her entire existence had become one smooth lie.

Nightmare roared, and another orb fell victim to its rage. This time, it was an event that no one even remembered anyway: a warrior saving a mute, and both immediately falling dead afterwards. At least Nightmare wasn't trying to actively cripple the timeline.

“He is pathetic!” Nightmare snarled. “No one! He should not have had the strength!”

Charlie remained silent. It was best not to interfere with it when it was like this.

“I will end that spider if it is the last thing I do.” Unnaturally long claws gripped an orb and held it in such a tight grasp that Charlie could see small cracks forming in it.

“Why are you so set on killing Webber?”

Those furious eyes landed on Charlie. She managed to hold her ground.

“You are not stupid,” it said slowly, furiously. “You know who he is.”

“The next Nightmare Captor,” she responded. “Maxwell's Heir. Of course.” It wasn't exactly a secret. Any creature could sense the sheer power of the aura he gave off, something that any Nightmare Captor needed above all else. He was going to be perfect. Perhaps the one to finally save this world.

“You speak as if it is a trivial manner!” Nightmare shook with rage. The orb cracked further. “To speak such a way about the Master's usurper... I dare call that treason.”

“Relax,” Charlie said breezily. “All will work out in the end. It always has.” She waved her arm towards the crumbling edges. Somewhere out there were faded, grayed out orbs, ones that had existed for longer than Charlie. It was enough to know that this wasn't the world's first timeline, nor would it be its last.

And every time they failed.

So why!?... What can I do to stop this disgusting cycle?

She closed her eyes and thought... then thought some more. She tried so desperately to dig up old memories, but none came. Nobody would ever have that gift... the knowledge that they had lived through this a thousand times before. Even Charlie, one who could read the world's source code, could not conjure memories of events that had yet to happen. But maybe... maybe she could stop those events from happening again.

She paused, then turned. Surely... no.

Charlie knew she had the same power as Maxwell... to bring people into this domain. But she couldn't subject another innocent to this Hell. Especially not someone like her sister.

But... she felt like she had to. Winona was the only person that Charlie could think of that would be able to fix this. She could fix anything...

As Nightmare realized it had lost her attention, it let out yet another roar of rage and smashed the orb it was holding against the ground. It immediately shattered into a million pieces, shards of memories flying out in all directions.

A random memory, one of a pair of twins playing in the snow, was lost to the pieces.

…

WX-78's POV

I didn't see Wilson again for many days. It was a fact that I knew should be more prominent on my mind, but I forced it to the back of my mind every time it came up.

During those days, I never strayed from Webber's side. His condition was so volatile that I did not dare risk it. After the first attack, he had been badly wounded, but nothing so terrible that good care couldn't solve.

This time, however... it was impossible to tell whether we should've been more focused on his hand or his eye. Matters were only made worse by the speech barrier between me and the spiders, and the ice hound's many attempts to 'help'. Eventually, I gave up shooing the dog away: after all, its cold fur would do good for the raging fever that Webber had developed.

The spiders made quick work of trying to save the hand, with many long hours spent cleaning and binding it once more. The initial stab wound had indeed been worsened, but Wilson had clearly done something more to it until I was tempted to remove it entirely. The spiders had disagreed with this notion, after I had finally gotten the intention across to them.

The eye... there was no way to save it, even if we wanted to. That was the one thing I had completely entrusted them with, simply because I wasn't sure I could mentally go through with it: removing what was left. It was better to do that than to hurt him more trying to save it. Even then, if we had been able to save the eye itself, there was no way he would've been able to see from it ever again. It was completely ruined.

Occasionally, I noticed him stirring slightly, usually marked by small whimpers and flexing claws. When the spiders weren't there, or when they were asleep, I would attempt to sooth him back to sleep. My voice was loud and robotic, not one for lullabies, but it usually seemed to do the trick.

There was improvement, but it was slow. I knew he healed faster than Wilson or I did, but it was still many days before he actually seemed to have lucid moments.

Surprisingly enough, I didn't find myself annoyed about becoming the boy's caretaker. It was almost... calming.

I saw his good eye open slightly, and the whiskers on his face twitched slightly. He winced back against the sunlight, but a moment later, he had a focused and steady gaze on me. I tried to ignore the thick silk patch across the remnants of his lost eye.

“YOU ARE AWAKE,” I observed. The dangling depths dweller- her name was Erika, wasn't it?- snapped awake and growled at him, waking her companion up as well. Webber hissed something back, his shaky voice obvious even in a different language. Finally, he looked back at me, his remaining eye round and... scared.

“We're awake...” he said softly. His voice was hoarse and ragged, clearly showing its lack of usage. “WX... what... what happened...? Why can't we...” His good hand made its way towards the patch across his face, touching it gently as if trying to figure out what it was.

Immediately, Erika snapped at him and I got to my feet. Webber snarled back at her, his fur bristling with agitation as his claws came out and he tried to tear the patch away.

I jumped forward and grabbed his hand, pulling it away. “DO NOT TOUCH IT.”

He snarled again, in the spider's language, and struggled against me. A wave of annoyance flooded my systems. Even coming out of what was essentially a coma, he was still going to fight with us every step of the way? I vaguely considered knocking him out again, but that risked doing even more damage.

“YOU ARE INJURED.” Clearly. “THAT IS THERE TO KEEP OUT INFECTION.”

Erika let out a spidery sigh and looked at me. As she did, I had a feeling that I knew what she was thinking. Just let him do it. He needs to find out one way or another.

I released his hand, and he immediately went back to tearing the patch off of his face. I could start to see the ugly wound across his face before the eye was visible. I found myself looking away. I couldn't stand to look at it.

“Why can't we see!?” He cried. It felt like a stab straight into my chest.

I finally turned back to him, trying to avert my gaze from the massive wound. It was hard not to stare, though; even after the rigorous cleaning the spiders had done, it was crusted with blood and pus, and squeezed tightly shut. I slowly paced up to him and offered my hand. “I THINK YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF.”

He stared up at me, his good eye wide and confused. Finally, he took my offered hand and allowed me to pull him up. The second I released his hand, he crumpled to the ground and tried to catch himself with his marred hand. Immediately, he snarled in pain and fell sideways, clutching his injured hand. “Can't stand,” he muttered. “Sorry...”

Erika hissed at him, and he shook his head, hissing back. I desperately wished that I could understand what they were saying, but he did look back up at me, his face creased with pain.

I felt like he really needed to see the wound in order to understand the severity of it, and it wasn't like it was the worst idea to clean it again, so I crouched down and picked the boy up in my arms, surprised again at how small and light he was. He let out a small yelp of shock, likely at the chill of my arms, but he didn't struggle.

I wasn't sure how long he would be able to stay awake: he was still gravely injured and it was surprising that he was this lucid.

And so, I tried my best to keep conversation with him, hoping it would be enough to keep him from drifting off again... even if the discussion wasn't one I wanted to have.

“HOW ARE YOU FEELING?”

He let out a small growl. “...not well.”

I tried to think of something else to say, but he got to it first.

“WX... what happened to Wilson?”

What was I supposed to say to that? What was he even asking? What happened to the Wilson we knew? Why did Wilson snap? Where was he now?

Well... it would be easiest to answer the last question. “I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM FOR MANY DAYS.”

Webber nodded slowly, visibly relaxing. He's afraid of Wilson.

His gaze snapped to the side and his whiskers began to twitch again. “The frog ponds...?” He asked softly.

“IT IS CLOSER THAN THE OCEAN.”

His good eye turned down. “We nearly died, didn't we...?”

At least that was an easier question to answer. “YES.”

“...did Wilson do this to us?”

Another easy question. “YES.”

He fell silent for a moment. His claws twitched slightly, and I saw him reach up to scratch around his injured eye. I pulled his hand away from it before he could do any more damage to the injury. “WX?”

“MMM?”

“...was Wilson telling the truth?”

I scoffed. “WHATEVER HE SAID, I PROMISE YOU IT WAS A LIE.”

“He said that nobody would ever want us,” he said softly. His voice was shaky, as if he was on the verge of tears. “He said that... that all that ever mattered was escaping. He said that our p-parents abandoned us... knowing who we were...” He choked on his words, a sob forming in his throat. “He said that no human or spider could ever want us.”

As he spoke, a frown grew deeper and deeper on my face. It sounded like Wilson, or whatever was possessing him, knew exactly what to say to hurt Webber. He had done more damage than I could see.

“WELL.” I said after a long moment. “I SUPPOSE IT IS A GOOD THING I AM NEITHER HUMAN NOR SPIDER.”

His gaze shot up, but I did not grace him with a look.

Once I knew that we were safe from any of the massive frogs that populated the area, I lowered myself to my knees and placed him onto the ground. He immediately dragged himself onto his hands and knees and scrambled to peer into the reflection.

I watched as his expression seemed to shift between a million different emotions. A claw reached up and touched the edge of the wound, then tracing the length of it. I could see the moment that he understood: his eye was gone, and he was never going to recover completely.

He stared down at himself for a long, long moment. I stood beside him silently, allowing him to grasp the reality of his situation. When he finally looked away, it was to use his fangs to tear away at the bandaging on his hand.

“WEBBER...”

He ignored me, tearing away at bloody silk until he was able to fully see the state of his hand. It had healed since I last saw it, but I could already tell that it would never heal well. Unlike his eye, it would still be usable... just not as much.

“We're lame,” he whispered after a moment. “Nono... nonono...” he slowly shifted back, decidedly facing away from the reflection in the lake in order to rest his pitiful gaze on me, as if I could do something. “Lame... lame creatures die...” he whimpered.

When I had been injured severely enough to impact any of my senses, it had been a rather easy fix. Wilson knew robotics almost as well as he knew medicine, and he had been able to repair me fairly well. I still had some trouble from time to time, enough for me to realize that my hearing was not on par with what it used to be, but I had never suffered maiming of this extreme.

His dominant hand was borderline useless and his eye had been destroyed. Whatever the future had in store for us, Webber would never lead the charge again.

“LAME CREATURES MAY DIE, BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHY HUMANS CREATED SOCIETY.” I shrugged, trying to brush off my own horror at the realization. “YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MORE OF A BURDEN THAN YOU ALREADY WERE.”

I thought it was a pretty comforting sentiment, but apparently Webber didn't think so as he immediately burst into tears.

I considered my options- honestly, saying nothing and letting him cry it out was probably the best option- but before I could act on any ideas I spotted movement. Immediately, I angled myself in front of the boy and stared down the figure that was hesitantly approaching us.

Wilson looked... pretty terrible, if I had to be honest. His gray eyes were empty, his shoulder tightly wrapped in grass-woven bandages and his broken arm hung from a sling around his neck. He kept his gaze cautiously down, but when he looked up, I could see the emotions sparking in his eyes.

I didn't care.

“I HAD HOPED THAT THAT HAD KILLED YOU,” I sneered. He winced, and looked back down at his hands. “ESPECIALLY AFTER HAVING NOT SEEN YOU FACE FOR SO MANY DAYS.”

“I had to... prove to myself that I was safe,” he whispered, wringing his hands together. I stumbled slightly as I felt Webber grasp me from behind, shaking. His fur was bristling, and his claws were digging into the metal of my back to the best of their ability. “Nightmare is gone,” he said. “It's angry... so angry... but I can't do what it wants me to do.” He looked up again, tears glittering in his gaze. I scoffed. I hadn't even realized humans could cry this much. “Even when it is controlling me... I can't kill Webber.”

“YOU MAY AS WELL HAVE,” I snapped. I hadn't brought a weapon with me, but I knew very well that I could easily defeat Wilson in a fist fight. In just a week, Wilson had gone from the one person Webber could trust above all else to his greatest fear. “GIVE ME ONE REASON WHY I SHOULD NOT END YOU RIGHT NOW.”

I expected Webber to say something, to come to Wilson's defense again, but he didn't. He only let out the smallest of whimpers.

“I wouldn't blame you,” he said, finally meeting my gaze. “I deserve anything... everything... for what Nightmare made me do. But... you know that it wasn't me. You know...! And it's gone, WX. I failed. I don't know what it will do next, but I promise that it will not be through me.” He exposed his hands. His fingers were rubbed raw to the point of bleeding.

I said nothing. I trusted him last time, and he drugged me.

“Webber, please...” Wilson turned to the boy, but as he did, his shaking became more intense and he bared his fangs. Wilson took a step back, his eyes wide. He had lost Webber's trust, and I didn't think he would ever be able to get it back.

“YOU DESERVE WORSE THAN DEATH. IF I COULD DELIVER SUCH A PUNISHMENT, I WOULD.” I thought for a moment, then added: “BUT I BELIEVE THE WORST PUNISHMENT THAT YOU CAN FACE IS HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ACTIONS.” I took a small step forward. “HAVING TO SPEND EVERY DAY WATCHING THE CHILD WHO TRUSTED YOU SO MUCH SHY AWAY FROM YOUR PRESENCE. SPENDING EVERY WAKING MOMENT HAVING YOUR EYES TURN TOWARDS THE BLOODSTAINED WOUND YOU MARKED ACROSS HIS FACE, OR WATCHING AS HIS AIM MISSES BY A MILE BECAUSE YOU DESTROYED HIS STRENGTHS.” The more I spoke, the more tears appeared in the scientist's eyes. He didn't deny it: he knew what he deserved. “YOU DESERVE TO SUFFER, BY WATCHING YOUR HANDIWORK AT PLAY. BY KNOWING WHAT YOU DID, AND HAVING TO SEE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY.”

Webber released me as I spoke, falling to the ground with a dull thump as he did so. I turned to look at him only to see agony scrawled across his face. This was a different type of agony than the pain he must have been experiencing from his wounds, though.

“I really am worthless,” he whispered, his voice so soft that I could barely hear it.

Ah... so my words had been what had hurt him. I suppose I had lied for long enough at this point.

“COME ON,” I growled at Wilson, who startled at my voice. If we made him leave, he would die. And death was too much of a release for him to deserve it.

Wilson hesitated, looking between me and Webber. I could see the pain in his gaze, but I had no proof that it was emotional pain. I had done a lot to him to keep Webber safe, but he would recover.

I bent down to pick the boy up again, but he flashed his fangs at me and dragged himself to his hand and knees, his injured hand held tightly to his chest. I felt a strange ache in my chest as I watched him struggle to stand on his own, but he was fragile and weak, especially after just having come out of a coma, and couldn't keep his balance for even a second. I didn't try to catch him. It was important for him to fall to understand. He would be able to stand, eventually, but he needed to learn sooner rather than later that he was going to have limits now, and he couldn't push them.

“WEBBER,” I finally said after I had decided that he had tried and failed enough. Any more and he would hurt himself.

“Please,” he whispered softly. I couldn't stop staring at that eye. I had never seen him look so… his age. “Please, we can’t- if we can’t even stand- what’s the p-point of us being ar-round.” His voice was a low whimper, and there were tears welling up in his eye.

“EVERYONE GETS INJURED,” I said matter-of-factly. “YOU ARE NOT EXEMPT, CLEARLY. THERE IS AN OBVIOUS RECOVERY PERIOD. ONE THAT REQUIRES THAT YOU RELAX AND DO NOT STRESS YOUR BODY ANY FURTHER.” The entire time, I found my gaze drifting back to Wilson, who I was sure I had never seen so still. I didn’t think that he had realized the amount of injuries the boy had sustained. “LET ME CARRY YOU, AND YOU CAN CONTINUE TO BE STUBBORN WHEN WE GET BACK TO BASE.”

His entire body shivered, and he stared at the ground for a much longer time than necessary, but he finally looked back up at me and nodded a single, small time. That was all I needed anyway.

Carefully, I picked him up once more, careful to keep my grip away from any of the injuries he sustained. I could feel the tension in his muscles, the aggravation that he was holding back, but he wasn’t stupid. Stubborn and frustration, yes, but not stupid. He knew very well that his body was too fragile to carry him right now.

I didn’t look back to see if Wilson was still with us. I couldn’t care less. He could decide to turn around and jump off of the cliffs for all I cared at that moment. However, after a few moments I heard the soft sounds of his footfalls behind me, trailing after us.

I still had no doubt in my mind that Wilson had been possessed by something. His outburst the day before, the full-body, heaving sobs that he had let out after he understood what he had done, was enough to prove that to me. But… he let it happen. If Wilson could let something like this happen, he didn’t deserve our trust.

Webber whimpered slightly as my grip on him tightened, but I paid him no attention. Wilson deserved nothing. No, he deserved worse than nothing. He deserved to be pinned by his hand and tortured in the same way he had tortured Webber.

But then…

I forced my limbs to relax. Wilson was my last priority. Once Webber was stable, healthy, then I would give him what he deserved.

“We’re lame. Lame creatures die.”

What was the point in trying to save Webber? His words, although harsh, were completely true. It was the simple concept of Survival of the Fittest. The weakest, the slowest, the more injured, would always die. Webber would never get better. I knew this, Wilson knew this, and Webber surely knew this. His injuries would always cripple him and hold him back.

Until one day… he would finally fall prey to the world, and something told me there would be no greater deity to bring him back like it did Wilson. We had to relearn how to walk. How to fight. How to hunt. How to see.

We had to relearn how to live.

The day we had woken from our pseudo-coma, we had been made incredibly aware that we were different. The injuries our body has sustained were nasty, and our dominant hand would forever weaken us. The spiders... my sister, and WX had done everything they could to save the hand, but I could tell there would be little use. The bones healed nicely, but everything else... everything inside, had been destroyed. We could curl our fingers, but not enough to make a fist, and independent finger movement was completely out of the question.

Our depth perception was awful.

During those first few days, after WX had brought us to the frog ponds and we had gotten a good, long look at the bloody injury slashed across our face, we immediately knew that our life as a fighter was coming to a close. With only one working eye, obstacles that were once minor inconveniences became major problems.

And then there was Wilson.

WX had explained the entire situation to us; something had taken Wilson's body and used it as a tool to hurt us. After two failures to end our life, it had given up. But every single time...

“Webber?”

Immediately, we found our body flying into a defensive position: fur bristling, fangs bared, and body curled to defend our stomach and neck. Wilson stood above us, his gray eyes turning into the smallest of frowns before he looked away.

“Um... it's been awhile since you were out of camp... WX wanted me to ask you if you wanted to go hunting with us.”

“Hunting?” Despite Wilson's presence, our whiskers angled forward and a surge of hope flooded our system. “We can hunt with you guys again?”

“Well...” He shifted on his feet, staring down at the dirt. He never met our gaze anymore. Somehow, that hurt almost as much as everything else. “Um... I guess... you can try...? But... uh... I think it would be best...”

Our shoulders fell. Of course... they wouldn't trust us to mess up a hunting trip. Even though summer, and the hunting troubles that came with it, had passed, we still couldn't be trusted for something like that. “Oh... of course.” Instinctively, we noticed that our good hand had reached up and was scratching around the scar across our eye. We forced our hands to fold together instead, not willing to remind ourself of the injury.

“WILSON, WE CANNOT STAY HERE ALL DAY. ARE YOU COMING OR NOT?” WX's voice startled us. We turned slightly to see that the robot had come up from our blind side. When he saw that the scientist had been talking to us, his face creased into a deep frown for just a moment. “WILL YOU BE JOINING US, TOO?”

What would be the point of us joining them? We would just be sitting on the sidelines again, watching them provide for us. Our stomach growled slightly, and we began scratching at the scar again. “...maybe we could... go on a walk... instead...” I mumbled. We wanted to be out of camp, but we didn't want to be coddled any longer. Maybe some fresh air away from any others would do us good.

We tried to ignore Wilson and WX's shared gaze. There was something in both of their expressions that we really didn't want to see. Wilson's... pain, guilt. WX's... anger, fury.

“Will you... um... be alright on your own...?” Wilson's eyes flickered to our injuries then back to the ground. “Don't do anything... urm... don't hurt yourself, alright?”

“We'll... we'll be fine. You don't have to worry about us every moment that you aren't watching us, you know.”

“DO NOT BE RIDICULOUS,” WX scoffed. “YOU MAY HAVE HEALED, BUT EVEN YOU KNOW THAT YOUR CURRENT STATUS IS UNDESIREABLE. YOU ARE STILL AT SEVERE RISK, EVEN IF YOUR WOUNDS HAVE CLOSED UP AND YOUR STRENGTH HAS RETURNED. WE ARE RIGHT TO WORRY.”

Our teeth bared at the robot in fury. His words stung so deeply that we instinctively acted in anger, a deep growl rising from our chest. “Even half blind and lame we're stronger than both of you!” I snapped. We didn't want to see their expressions. We knew what their eyes would say. And so, before they could react, we flipped around and ran away, as fast as we could.

We ran until we tired, which was much faster than we were comfortable with, then found a decent tree to lean against and buried our face. We took several deep breaths, trying to refill our lungs. Our claws reached upward again and began to scratch at the scar across our eye. We stared down at our damaged hand, closing the fingers as tightly as we could in an attempt to see if it was any stronger than the day before.

It wasn't.

We frowned, then used our good hand to close the fingers together. They felt stiff and tight, even when they weren't doing the work of closing.

“What do you think, Webber?” I asked. “You're in this predicament as much as I am. What should we do?”

“I'm surprised you would ask me.”

“There's no one else I can ask,” I replied wryly. “You at least... understand.”

The spider was silent for a long moment. “Well... it is true that our current condition is very disheartening. You should have killed the scientist.”

An image blasted in my head. Fighting back. Ripping Wilson's throat out before he had the chance to injure us.

I hissed, covering my head with my hands and shaking ever so slightly. “I couldn't,” I whispered. “Even if I could've... look at us now. We couldn't harm a rabbit.”

There was a soft growl. “You're right! Because you keep letting those worthless creatures tell you that you couldn't do anything! What is wrong with you!? You have turned soft, Tyler. Pathetic. You never let injuries stop you before. You were so determined to live that you overtook the mind of a creature that tried to eat you. Where is that child!?”

“You're... being surprisingly encouraging.”

“I refuse to suffer in the way you are determined to make us suffer. You have to prove to yourself that you are still strong.”

“You don't understand!” I snapped. “I'm left-handed, Webber! We can't even hold a weapon with my left hand anymore!”

“You have two hands.”

“Our eye is destroyed.”

“You have another eye that works.”

“That's not the point!” How could I get through this if even my own split personality didn't understand!? I took several deep breaths. “When a spider gets injured... when a spider loses a leg or loses an eye, they have seven others to fall back on. I've only ever had two eyes and two hands. You know that I can't use your legs, not like hands anyway, or your other eyes. I can't fight anymore.”

“Because you keep telling yourself that you can't fight. If you can't use your left hand, then use your right. If you can't see out of your right eye, then use your left.”

I looked up, whiskers twitching as I sensed something big nearby.

“Are you going to live the rest of your life believing that you're just easy prey!?”

I slowly got to my feet, smelling the air deeply. “No.”

“....What are you doing?”

“Exactly what you said. I'm proving that I can still fight.”

There was a foul smell in the air. It was heavy, musky, almost sour.

“Tyler, think about this. You can't go from being a deadweight for weeks to fighting a Giant. This is suicide! I... I can't let you do this.”

“You can't stop me!”

“I certainly can!”

Against my will, I threw myself onto the ground, teeth grinding painfully against each other and claws digging into the dirt. “W-We-bber!!” I roared. “Get out... of my... head!” In a flash of rage at my other half, I reached up and dug the claws of my good hand deep into the skin of my cheek. I tore away at the fur, leaving a profusely bleeding wound in its place. “You c-an't con-trol me! You n-ever could!” With that, I tore another chunk of flesh from my arm. “I'm tired of being treated... like I don't know anything! I'm tired... of being a spider! I'm tired of hearing you!”

“Tyler, Tyler, calm down! You're hurting us-”
“I'm going to get rid of you if I have to tear you away!”

“Tyler, please-” I could hear him gasping in pain. I couldn't feel it. All I could feel was his weakening presence, his desperate pleas-

Arms grabbed me, pulling my arms away from myself and holding them together. Just as I reared my fangs to attack, someone started shushing me and pulled me closer.

“I'm tired of being useless!” I struggled from the person's grasp, but they held me tighter. They were surprisingly muscular, the only thing that really keyed me in to... I didn't know this person.

That was what finally forced me to relax.

As the grip on me loosened, I struggled free and flipped to face the newcomer...

And found myself incapable of speech.

It was a human. Another human, another survivor. She had charcoal black hair pushed out of her face by a tied red headband. She wore torn overalls covered with dirt and grime, which also covered parts of her face and hands. A moment later, I realized she was staring at me just as intensely as I was staring at her.

“...Who... who are you?” I asked. Webber had fallen silent.

Before she could answer, the ground trembled beneath us. I felt my heart sink into my chest as the sour smell washed over us.

“Watch out, kiddo!” The woman grabbed our arm and started pulling us along, away from where the beast was. Immediately, we felt a growl rise in our throat and we yanked away from her before she could take us too far. “What are you doing? That beast can and will eat you!”

“Wouldn't be the first time.”

“Seriously, kid, listen, it's too dangerous around here. I promise I'm not going to hurt you. I'm... ha, I'm too thankful to see other living beings here to even think about hurting you. But that thing? That thing will kill both of us without a second thought!”

“No! We're not running. We set out to prove them wrong and we're going to do that!” With a twinge of regret, we added: “if you want to run, then do it. We don't need you anyway.”

“...They? Are there others?”

Her hopeful question was cut off as the Bearger made itself shown. Its gazed passed over the woman without issue, but those beady black eyes locked onto us with a sort of pure rage that we wondered if we had done something to it before.

“Kid... kid, listen. Back away slowly, don't make eye contact. It will just pass on by-”

“The name's Webber,” I informed her with a slight growl. “And we don't intent to let it pass by.”

“Grrr, fine. But I hope you have a good idea of what you're doing...”

We don't. We didn't have anything on us... no weapons, no tools, not even Popsicle. How did we intend to kill it?

“What's your plan?”

We didn't have a plan.

It roared at us, yellowed teeth stained with faint red juice. Our fur began to prickle. It took another step forward and...

We ran.

The woman let out an indignant shout as we left her behind, but we could hear her footsteps faintly behind us a moment later. Further back, the Bearger was giving chase.

Branches whipped at our face, tearing scratches through our fur and causing out remaining eye to water painfully. Without our depth perception, we couldn't even run. We couldn't get away. We just doomed ourself and this innocent fellow survivor to death.

Then, we realized something. Our whiskers were twitching furiously, vibrating almost, as water began to block our sight completely. We could feel the wind brushing against the tips of them, cutting suddenly and reappearing with the flashes of trees.

And we could sense the thickness of the ground below.

Our light footsteps passed over the ground with ease and without even the slightest of creaks. The woman wasn't far behind, and we could sense the ground groaning slightly under her feet.

The world was falling apart from the inside, and we had just stumbled across one of the weakest areas of the ground.

We skidded to a halt, and the woman ended up running into us unceremoniously. “You can't stop to catch a breath! Come on!”

“Wait,” I responded. The Bearger's huge size meant that it was having more trouble getting through the undergrowth than we had. It had resorted to swiping at thick foliage and tearing through the smaller trees in order to reach us.

We could see the moment it realized that it had been lead into a trap. One foot hit the thin ground, and the earth groaned in pain. Its momentum carried it into the next step, and then a third. By the fourth, the ground was beginning to crumble at its feet. It let out an enraged roar, lunging forward, but its massive body was tipping backwards as it attempted so.

And then, it was swallowed up by the darkness of the cave, its white fur blurring into nothingness as it fell down... down... down...

“The bigger they are, the harder they fall,” I said calmly, staring into the abyss as the woman's gaze stayed blankly on us.

…

“How long have you been here?”

Nighttime had fallen, and we were back at the woman's camp. She had nothing compared to us, just a firepit and some strange contraptions that she brought no attention to. She had to speak loud enough to overtake the sounds of the crackling fire that we sat beside.

We gnawed hungrily at a cooked rabbit as we thought of how to answer. It was a year now, wasn't it? It didn't feel that long. “A year... about.”

It took her many moments to process what she heard. “A... year...? How...? How have you been here that long...?” She suddenly seemed to look at us through a completely different lens... one of mutual respect other than a careful protectiveness. “I see... did the Bearger give you those wounds? It couldn't have, could it?” She motioned towards the healed gash across our tightly closed eye and the various, still-bleeding wounds we had inflicted on ourself earlier.

“No.”

She said nothing, seemingly waiting for us to continue. How much did she want us to say? How much did we want to say? I wondered, and realized... we wanted to tell her everything. We needed someone to talk to, to understand...

“No... our, um- our campmate...” We started scratching at the scar again. “There was an incident... he wasn't himself...”

“Hey, hey, I understand. If it's too painful to talk about, you don't have to talk about it. Go ahead and unload whatever you want on me, but don't force yourself...”

“Mmm...”

“Come on... anything?”

“We're not a full human.” What better place to start at than the beginning.

“I can see that. I chose not to question.”

How could she be so casual!? “We were eaten by a spider. We live as one, now.”

“That explains the 'we' talk.”

We growled. “Why can't you just react like a normal person? Scream, run away, or whatever you do. Don't patronize me.”

“Hey, don't act like I'm patronizing you. Listening to you is not the same as patronizing you.”

Change the subject. “How did you get here?”

She sighed. “The same way I'm assuming everyone did... a promise of something you lost.”

That piqued our interest. “Something you lost?”

“My sister. I haven't seen her since the San Francisco Earthquake, back in 1906.” She scratched at her head, under her headband. “I haven't stopped in my research attempting to find her since the day she disappeared with that no-good rat of a man...”

We had no idea what she was talking about, but nodded anyway. This felt... nice. Talking to someone we had never spoken to before. And despite our confusion and frustration that she wasn't reacting to us like most people did... it was nice.

“I thought... I thought I saw her. But the next thing I know, I'm waking up here...”

“How long have you been here?” How long have you been alone? Are there other survivors?

“...a week, I think... tell me about the others.”

“What?”
“You mentioned others, and a campmate. Are they friendly?” Her gaze shifted to the scar across our eye, but she look away quickly.

Why couldn't we figure out how to answer that question? There had been so much strife between all of us that we couldn't even confidently tell her that they were good people. Look at how much WX has helped us... without him, we would probably be dead right now.

“...You can say that.”

She frowned slightly.

“Are you wanting to join us?”

“Are you kidding? I'd kill to be part of a team again! As long as you and your group are okay with that...”

We looked up at the sky. It wasn't quite dawn yet, but the sky was beginning to brighten up. “You can meet them... it's your choice if you want to stay with us.” We finished the meat we were eating and wiped our mouth. “You never told us your name.”

“Oh jeez, you're right. We're both getting ahead of ourselves, aren't we?” She grinned. “My name's Winona. I've been looking for my sister, Charlie.” We led the way, Winona trailing a few steps behind us as we walked. The closer we got to camp, the slower and slower our steps became. They would be mad at us for running away, especially when crippled as we were. We chewed at the inside of our cheek as we worried over it. Winona had tried a few times to ask questions, but the clipped, short answers we gave her was apparently enough for her to realize that we weren't in the mood to chat anymore.

“Webber,” she finally said. We paused, frowning in the slightest. “Um... how much further? I'm not... used to this much leg exercise.”

If only.

We shook ourself off and quickened our pace again. “Not much more.”

“Do... do you even want to go back?”

This paused our step entirely, and Winona bumped into us as we did so. “...why do you ask that?”

She motioned to our face, and we felt a hand reach up to scratch around the scar again. “You don't seem... enthusiastic.”

We looked away, instead focusing on the ground beneath our feet. “They think that we can't handle ourself,” I said with a sigh. “It's tiring, constantly having to try to show strength. But we can't show weakness, or else we'll all die.”

“Who said you in particular have to be serious and strong all the time, though?”

Curling up with Wilson, purring, his hand scratching around our whiskers idly.

“Everyone. The world. Ourself.”

She nodded a few times, her face creasing into a scowl that she didn't seem to want to explain.

We thought that was the end of the conversation, but she continued a moment later.

“If you don't... want to go back to your camp, you don't have to, you know. Just knowing that there are other people here gives me hope. Especially people like yourself who have... well, survived for so long.”

“The world has been generous to us,” I said with a sarcasm she didn't seem to pick up on. “Come on. Just... don't be too...” What word to use? We grimaced. “Annoying.”

“You think I'm annoying?”

“No, but...” We took a deep breath. “WX-78. He's the robot, obviously. He's very touchy and very quick to anger, but... he's trustworthy. He's protective, in a 'nobody can hurt you but me' sort of way. Wilson... he's going through something. And... he lashes out without reason sometimes.” We unconsciously scratched at our eye, but at Winona's strange look, we took to scratching at the palm of our lame hand instead. “It's... best you meet them yourself.”

“...alright,” she said uncertainly. She didn't want to offend us, but she was also concerned now.

Well, that was probably best anyway.

…

We could only imagine what must've been going through Wilson and WX's heads when they saw us. We uncomfortably realized how much we must look like a scolded child, given our height and moping posture, so we forced our back to straighten. We were leading Winona here; she wasn't putting us in time out.

We stopped at the edge of our camp, and a long moment of silence passed between the four of us as Wilson and WX stared, uncertain and confused, at the person that we had returned with.

Winona was actually the one to break the silence.

“You must be... Wilson, right?” Winona asked the scientist. “And that makes you WX-78?” She nodded at the automaton, who gave a short nod in response. “My name is Winona. I bumped into Webber here directly before he got attacked by the Bearger.” We bristled at her words, even if they were true. They were going to think that we were stupid for running off.

“Forgive my silence...” Wilson said after a moment. “But... I never expected to see another living human here.”

Winona laughed a sort of stiff, uncomfortable laugh. “Yeah... I suppose it might get to you when your companions are a robot and a spider hybrid, right? Not saying there's anything wrong with that! In fact, it's rather awesome. But I can understand wanting to see another human.” She stepped forward, past us, and offered a hand to Wilson. He took it, his face still a picture of confusion.

“WEBBER,” WX said, piquing our attention. “CONSIDERING YOU ARE IN ONE PIECE, I CAN PROPERLY ASSUME... 'WINONA'... SAVED YOU FROM THE JAWS OF THE BEARGER?”

We opened our mouth to protest, but Winona got to it first. “On the contrary,” she said, a smile forming on her lips. “I dare say this boy saved me with nothing more than his knowledge of this world. You knew the ground was hollow there, didn't you?”

Three pairs of eyes, or lack of thereof in WX's case, landed on us. We almost shrunk under it. “...not quite,” I answered. “We... um... we sensed it when we were running.” We fixed our gaze on Wilson. We almost enjoyed watching him squirm under it, as he often did when he saw our missing eye. “It's gone. It died in the fall.”

“It what?” Wilson's eyes widened. “You killed the Bearger?”

“If it was up to me, we woulda run for the hills!” Winona boasted. “But not only did he know that the ground wasn't going to handle the Bearger's weight, but he also straight up stood against it!”

Normally, we weren't one to take praise, but we couldn't help but swell a little in pride as she spoke.

“...maybe we underestimated you, Webber,” Wilson laughed. He took a step towards us, but we found ourself instinctively shying away from him and towards Winona. Something flashed in his eyes, which was quickly transferred to the rest of his face into a sort of injured expression. If WX saw any of this exchange, he didn't let on.

“ARE YOU WANTING TO STAY?”

She opened her mouth to respond... then snapped it closed. She looked beyond our two campmates and pointed. “...there's a... um... a hound? And...”

Popsicle had risen to his feet, shielding Pyrite with his body. He wasn't snarling or making any noise, but his body was stiff and aggressive. We inched towards him, flashing our gaze between the hound and Wilson.

“It's okay, boy,” I called. As we did, Popsicle's body seemed to relax a bit. We glanced at Winona. “He's our pet. His name is Popsicle. The others-” we motioned towards Chester and Pyrite. “Chester came to us when we found that eye thingy in his mouth. Pyrite is... our trophy for defeating the dragonfly.”

Winona's eyes widened. “You've tamed a hound? How?”

“He's just a puppy. He was even tinier when he came to us.” We clicked our fingers and Popsicle trotted up, throwing looks over his shoulder to make sure Pyrite was following him. His cold fur felt nice against our hand. “He's loyal to the end.” Our eyes flickered towards Wilson and back again.

We winced back as a cold finger drew over our face. Instinctively baring our teeth, we glared at WX, who now held one blood-tipped finger up. “YOU ARE INJURED.”

We grimaced. “We had an argument.”

Winona opened her mouth as if to defend herself, but realized a moment later that we didn't mean her.

“...I SEE.”

There was something that we didn't like in his eyes- or, lack of thereof.

Instead of continuing the conversation, he threw his gaze towards Winona. “YOU. FLESHLING.” We couldn't help but laugh a bit at that. It had been a long time since he had said that term. “YOU HAVE ALMOST MISSED ALL OF THE FUN, IF YOU PLAN ON STAYING HERE. CAN YOU FIGHT?”

“Fight?” Winona's eyes widened, then she shrugged. “I mean... I've worked in a factory for years. I've never been trained in fighting but I think I have the strength.”

WX examined her closely, as if taking notes. Under his scrutiny, Winona only stood straighter.

“WILSON,” he said without looking. “I TRUST YOU CAN GIVE HER THE TRAINING SHE NEEDS.”

Wilson immediately recoiled, as if unwilling. “I-um- I mean- I can, but-”

“I WOULD, BUT I AM AFRAID I WOULD IMMEDIATELY KNOCK HER OUT. AND WEBBER IS LITTLE MORE THAN A PET, I BELIEVE.”

We puffed our cheeks out in anger at the comment, but it melted a moment later when we noticed the teasing note in his voice.

“NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO GET STARTED AS ANY. WEBBER, WHETHER YOU MIND OR NOT, I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU IN PRIVATE.”

We felt our heart sink. The last thing we wanted was WX to scold us. He had never worried about yelling at us in front of everyone, though, which really confused us. Before Wilson could even protest, the robot grabbed our arm and started pulling us away.

Immediately, a shock of terror exploded through our body, and the smallest of whimpers rose in our throat that we had to swallow down. We still ripped our arm away from him, though, staring down at our feet in hopes he didn't notice the panic response. If he did, he said nothing about it.

Once the others were out of sight, WX turned back to us, his 'eyes' narrowed. “YOU HAD AN ARGUMENT,” he said. He didn't sound convinced. “I WAS NOT AWARE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER WAS SEPARATE ENOUGH TO ARGUE LIKE THAT.”

We rubbed our arm unconsciously. So that's what this was about.

“I HAVE A QUESTION.”

We raised our head a little, but not enough to look at him in the face.

“AM I SPEAKING TO A SPIDER RIGHT NOW, OR TO A HUMAN?”

That was a question we weren't expecting. And it was a question we weren't sure how to answer. What kind of answer was he wanting?

“A human,” I answered softly.

“WEBBER IS NOT YOUR NAME, IS IT?”

“... no.”

He was silent for a moment. “I FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG,” he said. This was enough to prompt us to finally look at him. He was gazing into the middle distance, a strange look on his face. “I SHOULD FEEL EXCITED THAT WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES. THERE IS ANOTHER PERSON. SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAS SURVIVED. SHE CANNOT HAVE BEEN HERE FOR LONG IF SHE HAS NO FIGHTING EXPERIENCE, BUT... SHE IS ALIVE. THAT IS GOOD, IS IT NOT?”

“I suppose.”

“THEN WHY AM I NOT HAPPY?”

What kind of answer did he want?? What was he even asking? We opened and closed our mouth a few times, but no words came out. WX... he was sad that there was another person.

Something clicked. “WX... are you worried that we'll start to rely on her like we did Wilson?”

“QUITE PERSONALLY, I COULD NOT CARE LESS ABOUT WHO YOU RELY ON.”

We felt the smallest of smiles form on our face. “WX... thank you for everything that you've done for us. For me. We wouldn't be here right now without you, and nothing will change that. You denied it before but... WX, are we friends?”

He let out a short burst of garbled static- a wry laugh. “MY ANSWER REMAINS THE SAME. FORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE BECOME QUITE PERFECT CANNON FODDER, WEBBER.”

We only felt our smile grow a bit. “Just this once, you can call me Tyler.”

“A TERRIBLE NAME,” WX proclaimed. “NO WONDER YOU GO BY WEBBER.”

We laughed. It felt good to laugh. “Maybe, but you have to admit, it makes me seem a lot more normal.”

“YOU ANNOY ME GREATLY. SOMEHOW, I MISSED THAT.”

We let out the last of our mirth in soft chuckles, and as we did so, our eyes landed on our lame hand. We tried to turn it into a fist, but as always, our fingers barely touched the palm. Using our good hand to curl the fingers in, we look back up at WX. “Hit me.”

He tipped his head, but he didn't question. We didn't expect him to. A moment later, we caught his fist with our good hand, stumbling slightly behind the force of it. Even though it was enough to knock us off balance, it clearly wasn't his best.

“Don't go easy on me. You never have before.”

WX smirked, and he threw another punch. This time, we dodged it and ducked around him, fast enough to catch him off guard and throw our own punch. It didn't hit- he had the advantage of two eyes and no muscles to atrophy, unlike us, but we didn't let that damper our mood. Without prompting him again, he moved to hit us again, this time throwing in a kick as well, both of which we dodged.

“You keep aiming for my good side.”

“THE LAST THING I NEED TO DO IS BRING YOU BACK INJURED.”

We shook our head. “You won't hurt me. Pretend like I've never been hurt. Hit me like we are fighting, like we did back then.”

We could see the conflict in his expression, which solidified our suspicion that there was more than just survival that kept him from hitting us with full force.

What did he think of us? A friend? He denied it, but who knows how true that was? Someone to be protected? He always chastised Wilson for trying to do that very thing. A sibling? Would he even have a concept of siblingship?

Finally, he seemed to get over his hesitance. The next hit he aimed at us was directed towards our right, on our blind side. However, without even the slightest bit of pause, our whiskers on that side stiffened and we dodged it. We didn't notice that he had also moved to kick us again, and the force of his kick in our abdomen expelled all of the air from our body. We stumbled back, wheezing, and we saw WX take an uncertain step back.

Before we had the opportunity to regain our breath, we forced our body to slip around the automaton and push him roughly with our shoulder. We weren't strong enough to really push him, but his guard seemed to be low enough that he did stumble, and we managed to get him to trip and hit the ground with a heavy thunk.

We grinned at him, panting, then offered a hand to help him back up. He didn't take it, instead pushing himself back and brushing the dirt off of his metal frame.

“So, if we're not friends, then why did you save me?” I asked, dodging another punch from the robot and landing one of our own. “You could've let me die.”

“ANNOYING YOU MAY BE, BUT I HAVE GROWN QUITE FOND OF YOU. MUCH LIKE A PARTICULARLY ADORABLE FUNGUS.”

We laughed again. “So... like a brother.”

WX paused for a moment, twitching ever-so-slightly as if he were malfunctioning. “IF A BROTHER IS COMPARABLE TO A FUNGAL GROWTH, THEN BELIEVE WHATEVER YOU WANT.” Despite his words, he definitely seemed flustered.

Aha.

After dodging a couple more attacks from WX and landing a couple ourself, we dropped our fighting stance and straightened up. “That's enough for now. We've not been on our feet enough for a long, drawn-out sparring session.”

“YOUR REFLEXES HAVE NOT SUFFERED MUCH.” He sounded impressed.

“Told you we could fight.”

He almost looked like he was smiling for just a second, then his face fell. “THERE IS ANOTHER MATTER I WISH TO DISCUSS.”

“Oh?”

“THE BEARGER IS SLAIN, CORRECT? WERE YOU ABLE TO COLLECT THE FUR?”

My own mirth drained from my face. “No.”

“WE MUST ASK FOR THE SPIDERS' HELP IN RETRIEVING IT, THEN.” He nodded a single time, as if that had settled something in his head. “UNLESS YOU ARE FOND OF THE IDEA OF BLUNDERING THROUGH THE DARK.”

“I mean, Erika has already done a lot for us. The last thing we want to do is make her help us more.”

He nodded again, his face creasing into the smallest of frowns. “SHE HAS WILLINGLY HELPED. NOBODY HAS FORCED HER TO.”

“We're not saying they did! But... maybe this is something we should just do as a group? It might be good... bonding?” It would take a long time for any of the others to trust Winona, especially considering she had missed many of the worst things we had gone through, but we had to start somewhere.

WX sighed. “I SAID WE SHOULD ASK THEM FOR HELP SO THAT SHE CAN SEE YOU ACTING LIKE YOURSELF AGAIN. IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO CARE.”

The laughter bubbled back up in our chest. “Alright, alright, you got us there! Fine, we can go down, as long as we bring the other two as well.”

“FAIR.”

We tossed our head towards the direction of camp, encouraging us to go back. Without checking to make sure he was following, we started walking.

“WEBBER.”

We paused, tipping our head at him. He hadn't moved, simply stared at the ground.

“MAKE ME A PROMISE.”

“Huh?”

“MAKE ME A PROMISE,” he repeated. “IF I PERISH AND RETURN, LIKE WILSON... AND I DO ANYTHING TO HURT YOU, DESTROY ME.”

“WX...” We could feel our heart constricting in our chest. “Why would you even think that?”

His gaze settled on ours, a serious fire burning deep inside of it. “I WOULD RATHER DIE A HERO THAN LIVE TO BECOME A VILLAIN. AND IF I WERE TO WANT ANYONE TO END ME, I WOULD WANT IT TO BE YOU.”

“That sounds an awful lot like something a friend would say.”

To our dismay, that didn't earn any sort of positive expression.

“YOU REFUSED TO HARM WILSON. I WILL NOT STAND FOR THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MYSELF. IF I DIE, THEN I WILL DIE BY MY TERMS.”

“Why are you saying this now?” We frowned. “Are you okay?”

WX stared at us for a moment, and then another moment. We started to shift under his gaze before he finally responded. “MAYBE I AM NOT.”

We opened our mouth to prompt him, to understand, but he finally started forward, pushing past us roughly as if to hide his vulnerability behind rudeness once more. We gazed after him, trying to come up with anything to say, but we couldn't. Instead, we followed him, albeit a few steps behind.

WX was upset, and this was because of Winona. She hadn't done anything or meant to hurt him, but her existence here was enough to make him question things.

Was he worried that we would like her more than him?

And finally, something in our mind slid into place. No matter what WX said, no matter what he thought about us, if he didn't want our death on his hands or if he actually cared about us, he was really our best friend.

And nobody could replace him. We knew what we would see even before we opened our eyes. We debated not opening them at all, just letting the nightmare pass without a second thought or acknowledgment.

However, we knew very well it wasn't going to be like that.

We sighed, rolling onto our stomach and opening our eyes a crack.

“What do you want?” I growled. “To lecture me again?”

“I wouldn't call my advice a lecture,” the spider pouted. “You'd think after so long of being together you would realize that I do care about you. Some.”

“You only care for me when it concerns you.”

“Which, in case you haven't noticed, is all the time. Come on, Tyler, walk with me.”

I growled, but dragged my body into a standing position nonetheless.

We were in a place that I was unfamiliar with. The ground beneath my feet was smooth and golden, and there were high walls that reached far above my head completely surrounding the both of us. The walls and ceiling were plastered in jewels and gold, but the most noteworthy thing was the gilded throne towards the back. I reached a hand up and ran my fingers through my hair, relishing in the atypical but nostalgic feeling.

“We have been through a lot recently,” the spider mused. “Haven't we?”

“I have,” I snapped. “The last time I checked, you weren't the one getting mauled by your own teammate.”

“No, but you weren't the one that had your mind and body stolen from you.”

I threw my hands in the air in frustration. “It wasn't like I chose to be like this! I just woke up like this weeks after you ate me! In case you forgot this was entirely your fault!”

“We do things without thinking when we're starving,” he snapped, his front legs rising as if preparing to attack. “It is basic survival. I would've thought you of all people would understand that.”

I bit my lip, but I couldn't argue with that.

The spider seemed to relax a bit. He lowered his legs and continued walking. “Tyler, I think it's time we had a talk.”

“A talk?” I scowled. “What could we possibly have to talk about?”

“Many things. I can think of a hundred topics at the top of my head. Why haven't you murdered the scientist? What do you think of this woman breaking up your group dynamic?” He paused for a moment. “Why haven't you told them to call you by your real name?” He twittered for a moment, a strange spidery sound that I wasn't even entirely certain I could recreate. “But... the thing I really wanted to speak to you about was us. Our relationship.”

“I want nothing to do with you. It would make me happy to see you gone forever.”

“Well, that's not going to happen, is it?” Webber snapped. “And I think we should begin to make peace with that. Tyler, I believe we should have a... a truce.”

I startled, suddenly so confused I struggled to figure out how to respond. The spider crawled effortlessly into the throne and turned to examine my expression. He laid his body against it, holding his two front legs out and tapping them to a silent beat.

“A truce?” I sputtered. “What kind of truce could I possibly want with you?”

“Let me regain control. It doesn't have to be all the time... or even most of the time. But I can help you.” The spider's claws tapped faster and ever so slightly harder. His eyes were searching my own as if looking for the answer he wanted in them.

“Why would I ever do that?” I spat. “You are a cruel and vicious predator at heart, and that's all you'll ever be. You would kill my family in a heartbeat.”

“Family!?” The spider let out a howl of laughter. “Oh, you are kidding me! Is that still how you view them!?” He leaned forward, his white eyes glittering with cruelty. “Wilson tried twice to murder you. He forever crippled you, and what did he do afterward? Apologize? As if that could possibly make up for how he hurt you! He sliced your eye in half, he slit your throat, he pinned you against a machine with a knife through the palm and crushed that same hand, rendering it forever useless.”

I clenched my fists, suddenly acutely aware of both of my functioning hands, something I no longer had in the real world.

“And WX,” the spider continued. “He's even worse. He is a machine, Tyler. He can't feel love. He can't feel friendship. He can't feel anything except for hate. Because that is what he was built to do. He is not your friend. He knows that you are his only chance for survival, and because of that, he stays around. The moment he feels he can be safer elsewhere, he will leave without a second thought.”

“You're wrong,” I whispered. “Wilson... it wasn't him who did it. It was something else. Something that... that wanted me dead. And WX-” I swallowed back the emotions that were threatening to choke me. “WX cares for me. He saved me from Wilson. Without him, I would've died. He... he found the spiders in order to help heal me. He sang me to sleep when I was injured.” I took a deep breath, then rose my voice defiantly. “You say these things about them because you've never known a home, or a family, or friends. You've never been loved before. You're just a spider.”

“Tyler,” the spider murmured. “You don't understand, do you? Let me help you. Let me come out every once in awhile, just to help. My instincts are stronger than yours. My mind is sharper and my claws are faster. If they mean that much to you... then I will leave them alone. And the day they abandon you... the day you get yourself in trouble that will end with either your life or theirs... I will be the only one there for you.”

“That's never going to happen.”

“Really?” He folded one of his front legs under his body, but his other one remained stretched out in front of him, tapping the solid gold of the throne beneath him. “Do you believe they would risk their lives for you? Do you believe that you are just so important that they would die for you? Do you, Tyler? Do you really believe that?” He let out a spit. “Are you that much of a moron? You're just a foul... disgusting hybrid creature. A child who has already cheated death a million times too many. They are repulsed by you. They are disgusted by you.”
I took a step back.

Wilson's: No self-respecting creature would dare call you their own, human and spider alike.

But... WX's: I SUPPOSE IT IS A GOOD THING I AM NEITHER HUMAN NOR SPIDER.

“You are wrong,” I repeated, enunciating every syllable harshly. “I don't need you. I don't need you to survive, and I don't need you to act like you'll be there to catch me if I fall.” I straightened my back, glaring at the spider on the throne. “Because I won't fall. And if I do, they will catch me. And I will catch them. I will never let you have any control.”

A moment later, a yelp exploded from my throat as the spider lunged at me, knocking me over with ease and holding two claws over my neck, each one pressed against an artery. I bared my teeth at him, but realized a moment too late that there was nothing intimidating about a small human child doing that.

“You are blind,” he growled. “I am the only individual you can rely on. And if you won't give me control, then I will take it by force.”

“Just try it!” I spat in his face. I tucked my legs against my torso and kicked him away, scrabbling to a standing position and preparing for a fight. “You never have succeeded, and you never will. I will always be stronger than you. And if I feel like you are somehow winning-”

“Oh? What could you do to stop me?” He grinned as if catching a bluff.

“I'll kill us both,” I hissed. “I wouldn't hesitate. The moment I feel you taking control, I will spend my last moments of consciousness putting a spear through my neck.”

This actually caught the spider. He took a step back, then another one. There was a flash of fear in his white eyes.

“You lie,” he accused, but I could hear the hesitation in his voice.

“I value control over my life. If you think you're catching a bluff, just try it and see what happens. If I go down, I will drag you kicking and screaming into Hell with me.”

“And if you don't notice?” He leaned forward, that all-knowing grin settling back onto his face. “If you just wake up one day... unable to move. Unable to think. Screaming to be let out, but thoroughly ignored. What would you do? Would you beg? Would you cry?”

“WX already made me agree to kill him if he was being controlled by something and tried to hurt me.” I tipped my chin up. “I will force him to make the same decision.”

“Do you think he would be able to go through with it? If he supposedly cares for you oh so much, what makes you think he would do it?”

“Because he cares about me. Because he knows that it would be best for me. Because he knows that it wouldn't be me anymore, just a black-hearted monster posing as a child.”

“What have I done to be called a monster?” The spider spat. “Spiders are predators, Tyler. We hunt to survive. You seem to believe that me attacking you was some sort of... personal vendetta. But what is so different from me eating you and you eating a rabbit you plucked from its home? A goat that does nothing but stand uselessly in the middle of a dessert? Face it, Tyler. You are just as much of a monster as I.”

I ground my teeth, refusing to admit the truth in his words.

“You killed the Dragonfly, Tyler, and the Moose. Did you forget how both died under your hand? But only after you embraced me for just... a moment?”

I shuddered, forced to remember a feeling I didn't want to remember.

The Moose's massive body shuddering in agony beneath me as I clung to her like a burr. Blood pouring out of a gaping wound in her throat, bathing us in its metallic stench. Our vision swimming, the salty tang clouding his senses and driving me further back, shoving my consciousness deeper and deeper, the urge... no, the craving to keep stabbing her, to soak our bristling fur in crimson liquid and to feed... our stomach or this intense, petrifying bloodlust, we couldn't tell.

“Stop, stop,” I cried hoarsely. “That... that wasn't me. That was- that was-”

“That was me,” the spider purred. “And just like that, the first Giant was killed! Isn't that exactly what you wanted?”

“I didn't want that feeling. That... oh God...” Just the memory of it was bringing bile to the back of my throat. I held one hand over my neck and the other curled around my stomach.

“But without it, you would have died. And then the Dragonfly...”

This time, it was me. No otherworldly force was driving me into the throes of insanity, it was entirely my mind, my hand, gutting the massive beast like it was nothing more than a fish. I had been overcome with such a sense of rage... and so... so much pain.

“Tyler, without me, you will die in this next battle,” the spider said bluntly. “I know you will.”

“The next battle,” I echoed.

“You're going to fight the Ancient Guardian, yes?”

“...the Deerclops is the next seasonal Giant.”

“But your plans lay elsewhere,” Webber finished. He twittered again, that same strange clicking spider-y sound that was so strange to me. “Because this time, you want your sister beside you. The others agree?”

I stared at the ground.

“Oh, I forgot, you haven't asked them yet. Because you're afraid they'll make you wait until the winter. Because face it, Tyler, you want the bloodshed. You feel empty without having some grand creature to fight. The Bearger went down without trouble, and now you just can't get rid of that itch.”

He was right. Again. I absently ran a hand through my hair, frowning deeply.

“But that itch will kill you. I have seen it. And... I worry for you.”

“Why aren't you just a normal spider?” I exploded. The words came out faster than I intended, but the thought bit at me. “You're not! Spiders don't see things like that! Spiders can't give others visions!”

“Because unlike you, I have embraced Them!” The spider spat back. “And I use Them to defend you as I can. Without me, without my influence, you would have died every time you encountered a giant. WX-78? The tree guard? Wilson? You would have died every single time. But I can't stop this, not unless you let me. You forget that you are a child. Fragile, small, incapable of holding up against these elements without help... without my help.”

I said nothing, silently lamenting in my own memories.

“You are going to die,” the spider said again, but this time, his voice was weary, tired.

“No... no, I can't. If you can't understand that... then you can't understand anything about me.”

He sighed. “No, I do understand you. I understand you far too much. And that is why I feel so bad hurting you like this.”

“Hurting me?”

The question went unanswered, because next, I was being shaken awake. I blinked several times, pushing the person away from me. Some part, deep inside of my head, wanted to lash out. To cry and scream and attack anyone who tried to get close to me. I had been close to getting answers, I felt it! I didn't know what kind of answers but... anything more than I knew would be enough.

Luckily, my humanity beat that part down so that when I finally made eye contact with the person who woke me up, I was only glaring.

And much to my surprise... it was Winona who had woken me up. She had withdrawn her hands to her chest as if concerned that I would lash out, and her eyes were alight with worry.

I immediately felt my resolve crumble. This person... this person who knew absolutely nothing about me was worried about me. Had I cried out in my sleep? Was I thrashing about?

Maybe I was just snoring and she wanted me to stop?

“I'm sorry,” she blurted, holding her hands together. “I didn't want to- I just- you were-” she paused for a moment, then cleared her throat and tried again. “You looked like you were having a nasty nightmare.”

“A nightmare,” I echoed, then found myself laughing. Why was I laughing? Maybe because it had been so long since someone woke me up because I was having a nightmare? Wilson had for awhile when we first met, but he had quickly grown to understand that my sleep was always riddled with nightmares, and that I would get more sleep sleeping through them than I would being woken up every time I started to whimper.

I looked up, meeting her brown gaze as steadily as I could. Even the times that the spider and I had spoken on good terms (a rare occurrence completely) I would still wake up in a pool of cold sweat. There was a part of me that was terrified of him, had always been terrified of him. While interacting with him, or while awake, I was good at shoving that part back.

“Thank you,” I said after a long, long moment of silence. “I... I was having a nightmare. It's pretty normal for me, though... it's something you get used to living here.”

“Is there something you need to talk about?”

With her? No. I shook my head. “It's fine. Nothing you should bother yourself about.”

Winona sighed, then sat on the ground with her legs crossed. “If I'm going to stay here with you three, then I want to help in any way I can. Even emotionally.” The last part was said with a teasing note. When I still said nothing, she added: “ But-! I understand if you don't trust me enough to tell me anything yet! I just want you to know I'm all ears if you do need to talk.”

I nodded gratefully. This was a nice change of pace... letting me talk only if I wanted to. And I really didn't want to right now. I turned my gaze towards the trees curiously. It was still nighttime, but the full moon was out, allowing for me to see through the dark.

I sensed the spider's presence in the back of my mind, peacefully observing. We sighed, rubbing our eyes. “We're going to go on a walk... if you want to join us.”

Winona perked up. She stretched her arms out until they popped, grinning wildly. “Great! I could go for a bit of a muscle workout.”

“WEBBER.”

We flinched so hard at WX's voice that we nearly fell over. The robot didn't need to sleep, but somehow, we had forgotten this fact. He had probably silently listened to all of that.

“I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS SAFE.”

We turned to face the robot, who was sitting beside the fire as he normally did at night. His expression was still distant, dazed, suggesting he had been staring, enamored, at the flames again. But now, he was looking up at us, a critical glint in his 'eyes'.

“Don't worry, WX, I'll be with him.”

“THAT'S WX-78 TO YOU,” the robot snapped. His shoulders had risen defensively. “YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH ME TO CALL ME A NICKNAME.”

Winona winced. “Sorry, WX-78, I didn't know that counted as a nickname to you.” She shrugged. “If you want to come, too, you can. I have something cool to show you guys anyway.”

“WX,” I said, letting a hint of warning enter our voice. “It's okay. We'll be okay.”

“I AM NOT LETTING YOU BE ALONE WITH A PERFECT STRANGER SO SOON AFTER FINALLY HEALING FROM YOUR LAST ORDEAL.” The robot stood, taking a moment to brush away a scattering of dirt from his legs.

“He makes a good point,” Winona said approvingly, nodding at the robot. WX scowled back at her. “I wouldn't have trusted anyone with Charlie when she was your age. Then again, I barely trusted myself.” She let out a small peal of quiet laughter. “The amount of times she nearly poked her eye out trying to play with my tools! I guess that's what happens when you're fifteen years old with a love of wrenches and have a mischievous four year old running around.” She grinned at us, then beckoned for us to follow her. “Come on, I think you two are gonna find this as cool as I did.” I couldn't help but note that our travels were typically more quiet than this.

Webber was silent, almost sulking, which I wasn't surprised about. However, Winona ahead of us hummed and whistled and sang small bursts of lyrics under her breath, as if she couldn't stand the silence. It was strange, as the only one of us with any interest in music was Webber, and even then he would rarely even hum and only sang to annoy us. Winona, however, was clearly unused to simply listening to the sounds of nature.

I nearly said something on more than one occasion, but I managed to bite my metaphorical tongue.

“You know, WX-78, I don't know anything about you,” Winona said during a small pause. “If you don't mind me asking, where were you built?”

I winced ever so slightly. “I DO MIND YOU ASKING THAT QUESTION.”

“Oh.”

“IS THAT HOW YOU INTERACT WITH OTHER HUMANS?” I scowled. “NO MATTER WHAT YOU MAY THINK, I AM AS SENTIENT AS ANY OF YOU.”

“I don't doubt that. You seem highly advanced.” A moment later, she added: “I've just never seen a robot like yourself. I've seen plenty of robotics, but none that can walk or talk or, well, think. You are a marvel of technology, you know.”

“I KNOW.” That was the entire reason I was built, after all. I hated to admit it, but I did feel the slightest bit of pride in myself. 'Highly advanced' indeed.

“It's a shame, though, that you still go by your model number. Even the machines I've seen, far more primitive than yourself, we call them silly nicknames. Sasha was one of my main machines, you see?”

I thought about that for a moment, struggling to formulate a proper reply. Nicknaming machines? How peculiar. “IT IS MY NAME,” I said simply, unable to come up with anything better. “IT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO CALLING YOU BY A RANDOMLY GIVEN NAME. IT WOULD NOT FEEL RIGHT, BECAUSE IT IS NOT YOU.”

She considered this for a moment, before bobbing her head in a nod. “That's fair. Well said.” She threw a grin over her shoulder.

“Tell us about your sister,” Webber said, softly. I startled at hearing his voice, having almost forgotten that he was walking beside me. I don't even know how I could've forgotten, though- he was close enough to me that his whiskers brushed against my side with every step. “You mentioned that that's why you were here, right?”

Winona nodded at me to continue forward and she drew back a bit to trade spots with me. I didn't know where we were going, but she would probably say something if we were supposed to turn or anything. So, I took the lead after a moment, and silently listened in on her conversation with the boy. I wanted to make sure I didn't stop hearing her, unable to admit that I was still afraid for Webber's safety.

“My sister, yeah. Charlie. She and I- well, we were really close when she was little. I was an only child for so long, you know? We drifted apart as I got older, though. We had very different goals in life, but we never stopped keeping in touch.”

Why was I afraid for Webber's safety? He was strong enough to handle himself, and if he wasn't, why would I care? Why did I defend him from Wilson in the first place? How could someone so fickle in the face of danger be someone that deserved to be defended?

“I worked hard to become proficient in mechanics. I've always been interested in them. In fact, I've been taking apart and putting things back together since I was younger than yourself. Charlie, though... Charlie was the brightest, most creative person you could possibly meet. She was one of those people that you couldn't help but love as soon as you met her. She just had a way with people.”

Why wasn't I able to kill Wilson? I should have been able to. I had every reason to. Yes, Webber had asked me to spare him, but why did I listen to him? What could he possibly do to me to force me to spare the scientist? He was a loose cannon, now. He wasn't safe, and he had never been useful.

“Maybe that's why we got along so well, though. Charlie and I were polar opposites, but we complimented each other. When she met William, I tried to be happy for her. She was so in love with him, and he seemed so in love with her. They met by chance, you know. He needed an assistant for his magic show, and she was interested in stepping out of her comfort zone.”

I was growing soft, wasn't I? I was...

“It was supposed to be their final act together for awhile. They were going on a break, just to the family cabin for awhile. But... I don't know, something happened.”

I was developing emotions. True emotions.

I was built to emote, only slightly. But these were something different. What I wasn't built with was the ability to connect to living creatures.

Which meant that I was evolving past my coding.

Which meant I was more than just my coding.

“I should have protected her.”

I startled, hearing a second, softer voice echo Winona's as Webber whispered under his breath.

“...should have protected her...”

“I knew there was something wrong with him. I should have stopped her from seeing him again. She told me that something was happening to him, but that she still wanted to do that last show. She wanted nothing more than to be by his side. She really did love him.”

“...really did...”

“But now... she's gone. Something... some creature took both of them. That blasted man... he had played with fire far too long, and she suffered because of it.”

“...she suffered because of it...”

Winona was quiet for a moment, before saying in a soft voice. “Webber, are you okay? You're thinking about something... someone else, aren't you?”

He twitched ever so slightly, as if he didn't realize he had been speaking out loud. “Huh? I, mmmm, don't worry about it. It's nothing, really.” He shook his head.

“YOU ARE THINKING OF YOUR SISTER, CORRECT?” For the first time, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of interest. What exactly had happened with his sister? There was a lot of blank spots there.

“Maybe I am,” he said hotly. It was the kind of tone that he used that suggested no further conversation on the topic.

“WX-78, what about you? Talk about yourself a little bit. The best teamwork always happens when you know all your teammates.” Winona spoke with a hint of pride in her voice, as if this was an idea that she had come up with on her own.

“NO.”

“We don't even know all that much about him,” Webber said. “He likes to play Chess.”

Surprisingly, I found myself embarrassed. Winona didn't laugh, though, or even break an amused smile. She only nodded, as if it was to be expected. “Oh, I'm not surprised at all. Anything else?”

When Webber didn't offer anything else, apparently waiting for me to speak for myself, I finally admitted something. “I ENJOY BAKING.”

This time, Webber laughed. “No way! Really?”

“WHAT IS SO SURPRISING ABOUT THAT?” I snapped. “IT IS A PERFECTLY REASONABLE PASTTIME WHEN YOU ARE NOT CONDEMNED TO HELL.”

“It just doesn't seem like something you would do,” Winona offered. “Nothing wrong with it at all. In fact, I find it neat.” She grinned at me, and I scowled back at her. How patronizing. “Obviously, I'm not much one for hiding stuff about myself. I'm a mechanic, and that's basically my main focus in life. Although, I'll admit, I've taken a liking to sewing when the situation calls for it.” She paused, reaching out to touch my shoulder as if to inform me that she had stopped. “Oh, hush hush, I think we're close.”

I tipped my head curiously up, gazing at my surroundings. At some point, we had ended up in the birchnut forest that I often came to for things to carve. However, we were deeper in it than I normally went. The trees grew so close in some areas around us that I could barely even see the sky, which was glimmering with hints of dawn. “QUITE A WAYS AWAY,” I muttered.

“It's closer to where I woke up, actually,” Winona said, spreading her arms. “I wandered around for awhile before deciding to build a fire before being caught out at nighttime. Which, as it turned out, was a pretty great idea. But it's where I woke up that you guys will enjoy.” She took the lead once more, beckoning us to follow her. I felt Webber's whiskers brush against my side as he came to stand beside me again. He was squinting ever so slightly as if struggling to focus ahead of him.

“TROUBLE SEEING?” I asked softly- well, as softly as I could. Webber shook his head in response.
“It's a bit harder when we're unfamiliar with a place, but we'll be fine.”

Winona's careful steps took us into a clearing. Not a single tree stood in between the ground and the sky, bathing the ground in early dawn light. Webber paused beside me, his eyes widened as his gaze landed on the same thing I had spotted. “Whoa.”

In the very center of the clearing, there was a statue that stood taller than any of us, but not by much. It was a stone pillar, with a carving of some sort of creature on the very top of it. On top of the statue was the very creature the statue represented, resting peacefully as if unaware of the others than were staring at it.

I noticed Webber make a face as if he smelled something awful, but I had already prepared myself for the stench. There was a flower growing at the base of the statue, something I actually recognized as being incredibly similar to a corpse lily, hence the smell.

However, I barely even glanced at it all- the creature, the statue, the flower- before my gaze settled decisively on the object that was piercing the flower to the ground.

“Wicked, isn't it?” Winona whispered. “That creature was here last time, too, but it didn't move or anything. I figured it was asleep. It looks awake now, though?”

“Is that...?”

“A SWORD?”

Winona grinned. “That was the thing I wanted to show you guys most of all. I couldn't get it out of the ground at all, but it's glowing a lot brighter than it was when I first saw it.”

The blade had the flower pinned through the very center. It was a bright, almost intense blue, and it was certainly glowing quite brightly.

“Is that the Glommer?” Webber asked, tipping his head at me.

I nodded. “I BELIEVE SO.”

Tentatively, Webber shimmied towards the creature, giving it a cautious look as he neared. It blinked its many eyes at him lazily, as if it couldn't care less whether they came closer or not.

Frankly unwilling to let him stand up against a strange monster alone, even if strange monster looked wholly underwhelming, I stayed beside him.

Finally, we were close enough that I was able to reach out and touch the stone statue. The Glommer burbled as I did so, but it continued to just look at me.

Webber went straight towards the sword. The glow reflected off of his good eye and cast his missing one in shadows. He reached forward and took the hilt in his hand, then effortlessly pulled it from the flower.

“Whoa,” Winona breathed, leaning forward. “It must be the full moon last night. At least, it looks like it absorbed moonlight.” She held her hands out, and Webber gently held the weapon out to show it without giving it to either of it. It was a breathtaking sight, and something about the sword looked like it fit the boy quite well, despite being too big for him.

“It feels... alive,” Webber said in wonder, rubbing his thumb against the flat side of it.

I placed a hand on Webber's shoulder. “COME. WE MUST BE GETTING HOME SOON, OR ELSE WILSON WILL NOTICE OUR ABSENCE.”

“He definitely already has,” Winona said. “Let him hold it for a bit longer.”

I shrugged. “I FIGURED HE WAS GOING TO KEEP IT.”

“Keep it?” Webber asked hopefully, his eye lighting up. “We... we figured you would think us too weak to have a weapon like this.”

“YOU PROVE US WRONG EVERY TIME WE SAY SOMETHING OF THE SORT,” I pointed out. “IF YOU ARE ALREADY HAVING TO RELEARN HOW TO FIGHT RIGHT-HANDED, IT WOULD BENEFIT YOU TO LEARN HOW TO USE A SUPERIOR WEAPON.”

“Especially if we're going to be fighting the Ancient Guardian,” Webber agreed, smiling faintly. “We're terrified of the thought, but this makes us... excited.”

“THE ANCIENT GUARDIAN?” We hadn't even killed the Deerclops yet, and I said as much. Webber puffed his cheeks out and looked away.

“Well! It's not going to be Winter for awhile yet, and we still need to gather the Bearger's fur, which is in the caves,” the boy reasoned. “Plus, we would not be opposed to working with the spiders again.”

I nodded. It didn't sound like that was his real reasoning behind wanting to fight the Ancient Guardian, but it was as good a reason as any. We would need to fight it either way, the order didn't exactly matter. “FAIR. I SUGGEST MENTIONING IT TO WILSON BEFORE ASSUMING WE ALL AGREE, THOUGH.”

“Mhmm!” Webber didn't take his eyes from the delicate blade. I couldn't help but feel amused. He was acting like a kid in a candy store, and I couldn't help but enjoy that fact. Especially since this reaction was coming from him holding a clearly superior weapon to anything we had used before.

“WINONA.” I turned to the mechanic, scowling ever so slightly. “I HOPE YOU ARE PREPARED. THIS NEXT GREAT BATTLE MAY BE SOONER THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED.” I absolutely, one hundred percent cannot believe I let them talk me into this.

The caves were dark, we all knew that. That was basic knowledge.

However, this, whatever this was, was completely different.

Webber, WX, and Winona had returned late in the morning a few days before, and I found myself nearly passing out in relief seeing that they were all unharmed. Delicately, as if worried that he would drop it and it would break, Webber held the hilt of a beautiful blue sword that glowed faintly in the dark and put his old knife to shame. I had immediately debated whether to take the weapon away from him, but quickly decided against it. It was too big for him and definitely dangerous, but Webber had proven himself more than capable of wielding such a weapon. At least, he probably wouldn't poke his other eye out with it.

Webber had hesitantly mentioned something by the fire that same night, about the Ancient Guardian. I had pointed out that we had agreed to fight it last, which WX had seconded. But the boy seemed so strangely eager, leaning forward until he almost fell and speaking his argument quickly.

It didn't matter what order we fought them, he said.

We were going to have to go to the caves anyway, he said.

But it was something else. Something that he didn't say, but I could see in the way that he was clenching his good fist, and the fire sparking in his eye, that got me to agree.

Webber wanted a fight.

I couldn't imagine why, but it wasn't going to hurt us any. It was something we were going to have to do eventually.

Getting into the caves had been easy, as finding the Bearger's corpse had been. A particularly ugly spider had confronted us by the corpse, but Erika had quickly appeared and disengaged before anything could happen.

Now, the white spider was beside her brother, taking the lead of our pack. A handful of other spiders followed from a distance, only given away by the occasional glimmer of arachnid eyes or muted hisses. I couldn't help but realize that the spiders were specifically looking at me half the time. I squirmed under their watching eyes, knowing full well that I was not welcome amongst them.

In front of us was a massive, high-walled labyrinth.

I shivered as cool air blew from somewhere down the winding halls, knowing full well that whatever was causing that breeze was not natural.

You know, maybe this wasn't worth it. Maybe it would be best if we turned back now.

Even as the thought crossed my mind, I saw an uncomfortable expression on WX's face, hinting that the automaton was very much thinking the same thing as I.

Winona seemed almost oblivious. She actually marched past Webber and Erika, crouching down by one of the walls and running her fingers down the smooth, golden material. “I've never seen anything quite like this,” she said, a surprised note in her voice. “Is this material natural here?”

Webber tipped his head as he paced up to join her, resting his hand against the wall. “It's warm,” he observed. “Erika-” his voice degraded into a set of short hisses, which the white spider replied to. He nodded. “Thulecite,” he said. “That's what Erika says it's called. She said it's been here longer than they have, so who knows where it came from.”

“THE FLUX IS STRONG HERE,” WX said. “IT IS... LIKE THE AIR IS THICK WITH IT.” He said the words with a sort of disgusted tone, as if they didn't sit right with him.

“I mean, I suppose if we look at it that the Dragonfly is what caused the Summer to be so deathly hot,” I started, observing the surroundings without touching any of them. Warm, ancient walls in a dark, freezing cave was more than I wanted to handle. “Then we can also infer that the Deerclops is making the Winters significantly worse. And following that logic, it would make sense that the source of... the 'flux' here... could be the Ancient Guardian.”

There was a long moment of silence between us, and with it a painful tension between us.

“Well, we're not getting any younger.” It was Winona who broke the silence. She took her hand away from the thulecite and grinned at the rest of us. “Are we doing this or not? It's not too late to turn back, you know. The, uh, Ancient Guardian isn't going anywhere, you know.”

Even as she spoke, Webber was shaking his head. I felt my stomach drop. I just wanted to get out of this terrifying place.

“No, we should do it. Running now is just going to ruin whatever courage we've built up.” He took a look at me and grimaced. “Well, what little courage, that is.”

“I BELIEVE YOUR SWORD IS REACTING TO THE ENERGY HERE.”

It was true, I realized. The sword had been growing brighter so gradually that I somehow hadn't even noticed that it was becoming brighter than our torches. Webber's black fur was glowing silver in the blue light, and WX looked almost ghostly.

“Maybe that means we're meant to be here, then,” Winona pointed out. “If we found that sword just a few days ago, and there is a decision almost immediately after to fight this thing- followed by the sword actively reacting to whatever is here? I say that means this is exactly what it wants.”

Webber nodded in agreement. “Yes. Let's go, before we all chicken out.”

Without waiting for us to respond, the boy broke ahead again, the sword's light following him. I kept a steady grip on my torch, not entirely trusting that light to stay. WX looked up, a look that was definitely concerned plastered on his face as his gaze traveled up the wall of golden mineral.

Despite the brightness of Webber's sword, not a single glimmer of blue light reflected off of the wall. It didn't brighten or shine at all. Even when light was directly placed near it, it remained dingy and dark.

It was like the walls were absorbing the light, or even rejecting it. I shivered, whether from the cold or fear, I couldn't tell. I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to quell the goosebumps rising on my flesh.

The floors beneath our feet began to gradually change. I would see an occasional glimmer of red light seeping through cracks in the rock, and over time, these cracks grew larger and more frequent. The rock seemed to get darker with every step until it appeared as if we were walking on nothing.

Winona occasionally reached over and pried pieces of crumbling thulecite away from the walls, or bent down to hold a piece of black and red rock in her hand. She was pocketing them, as if saving them for further observation later. I, however, kept my hands firmly at my side. Materials that rejected light were more than just materials, and I was afraid of what long-term exposure to it would do to me.

Maybe I was just afraid of Nightmare using this as an opportunity to take control of me again.

There were several times were we could come across several splitting paths, but Webber wouldn't even look at the others before choosing one. His whiskers were twitching furiously, occasionally brushing against the thulecite as they did.

In some places, the ground was covered with vast expanses of sticky webbing. Dangling Depths Dwellers, like Erika, would stare at us from the ceiling as he walked through their territory, but none of them ever attacked us. Was that because of Erika being one of them, or did they, too, despise the cold touch of the flooring? I looked up uncomfortably. How long were these halls?

“So, Wilson.”

I nearly jumped out of my skin as I heard my name. I snapped into attention, turning my eyes to Winona. The mechanic had dropped a few paces back, matching my step.

“You're a scientist, right? I don't think I've ever heard what branch you studied.”

It was an innocent enough question, although one I hadn't answered in a long, long time, mostly because I didn't really have a good answer. I shrugged, struggling to hide how creeped out I was by this place. “I don't really study a specific branch,” I replied. “Mostly, ah, invention. But I've always been fascinated by the unknown. The things that scientists struggle to explain.” I found myself almost laughing at that, especially as Winona broke out into a grin.

“Ah, so places like this must be your cup of tea.”

“Not quite. I prefer things that are hard to explain, yes, but also things that... can be explained. Not walls that can eat light.” I beckoned to said light-eating walls.

“Fair enough. But you know medicine and mechanics?”

“Oh, no no,” I laughed. “I know basics of both, mainly just from classes. Keeping out infections and tending to injuries is one of the first things I learned. And, despite how complex WX is mentally, his inner workings are actually pretty easy to understand.”

Winona nodded thoughtfully.

“In fact, if you know your way around any kind of technology, I imagine that you would be able to read him like a book. Well,” I glanced at the robot, who was staring down at his feet so intensely I almost wondered if there was something upsetting him other than just the spooky surroundings. “You can read his structure like a book. Maybe not him.”

She laughed. “Well, that makes sense. I kind of got that from him already.”

“I mean, we've-”

“Hush!” Webber hissed back at us. He had stopped abruptly ahead at what looked like a completely normal branching of the labyrinth. He tipped his head, then nodded, hissing something at Erika.

“Is this the end of it?” I asked, confused. How could he possibly know it was any different than the rest? Other than the darkening floor, everything looked the same.

“Mhmm.” He readjusted his grip on the sword, holding it awkwardly with his right hand. I felt a flash of panic in my chest. He could barely fight with his right hand, let alone use a weapon than he had never trained on even with his left hand.

WX finally looked up, scowling fiercely. “IF THIS IS THE CENTER OF IT, I WOULD APPRECIATE KNOWING HOW YOU LED US HERE.”

A look of confusion suddenly sprouted on the boy's face. “Um... that's... a good question.” He looked around, his eyes dancing around the faint designs on the thulecite walls. “Maybe it's just the way the energy feels. Almost... like it was helping us, you know?”

WX did not looked satisfied with the answer.

“It's definitely stronger here,” I agreed, although I had no idea if it actually was. I was too busy feeling like I was suffocating in the darkness to notice if it felt any more suffocating or not.

The boy hushed me again, even though I was quieter than he and WX had been. He pressed his back against the wall and looked around one of the corners. Curious, I moved beside him, trying to see what he was looking at.

As soon as I brushed against him, he recoiled as if he had been hit. He glanced sheepishly up at me before shying away. I had just enough time to be disappointed before I glanced around the corner.

The halls of the labyrinth fell away ahead, revealing a massive platform that was surrounded on all sides by deep, dark gaps. Flowers tipped with glowing light bulbs illuminated the area so much that I could see everything inside of the platform- the deathly sharp stalagmites and stalactites, the occasional pillar formed by those rock outcroppings fusing together, the puddles of water that littered the pitch black rock.

But most of all, it illuminated the hide of a huge, gray-furred beast.

It looked like it was... asleep. It had two massive trunk-like feet tucked beneath its shaggy gray fur, and a terrifyingly sharp and terrifyingly sturdy, pale gleaming horn.

The horn.

That was our target from this creature.

I swallowed heavily. It wasn't as large as any of the Giants, it had no claws or deadly sharp teeth. It had no fire or ice, no furious tornado minions and no roar that could send an entire army to its knees.

And yet somehow, it was the most terrifying thing I had ever laid eyes on.

“It's in there,” I whispered to WX and Winona, who nodded. Winona looked almost excited, and WX had a fierce grimace on his face. Webber's expression was mostly neutral, in the fact that there were so many different emotions struggling for control that no one stood out to me.

“Let's do this, everyone.”

I was the first to break away from the safety of the walls. My footsteps seemed unnaturally loud, especially since they seemed to grow louder as soon as I was away from the maze itself.

Before I got too far, I glanced back at my companions. Webber was readjusting his grip on the sword as if he couldn't quite figure out how to handle it, and Winona was furiously wiping her nodoubtedly sweaty palms against her overalls. WX was the only one who stayed on my tail, as did Erika and a small group of the spiders, although they were a bit further away. At my look, the other two finally joined me.

I don't know what it was- maybe it was the presence of strangers in its territory, or maybe it was the muttering hisses of the spiders. Maybe it was just the heavy footfalls of the robot directly behind me. But before we got much further in, the beast's blank eyes opened and its face twisted with rage.

I didn't even have time to take a deep breath before it charged. No more than five seconds after the Ancient Guardian woke up did it rush to attack us. Our companions immediately scattered as it did, and we felt a hint of guilt as we noticed that more than one spider had been trampled before the battle even began. We caught Erika's eye, trying to express our apologies silently, but she shook herself and forced her gaze away from her fallen companions. “They knew the dangers joining this,” Erika promised, although we could hear the pain in her voice. We almost responded, but we were cut off as the Ancient Guardian let out a roar of rage as its attack landed in the high walls of the labyrinth. Its horn buried deep within the crumbling material, and we rushed forward to take our opportunity.

Before we reached it, though, it tore away from the thulecite, pelting us with golden shrapnel as it did.

We saw Wilson get hit with a sharp of stone, and he grasped his arm as a thin trail of blood leaked from the new wound. He looked furious.

Erika was shouting orders to some of the spiders, struggling to keep the beast confused and occupied. A couple of spitters fell from the ceiling, landing heavily on the Guardian's back and hanging on like ticks. Without even appearing to notice them, the Guardian bucked into the wall again, sending out another spray of slices of rock. We took an uneasy step back, suddenly confused as to what the creature was trying to accomplish. It wasn't paying any attention to us at all.

Again and again the Guardian smashed into the wall, each time sending larger and sharper pieces of stone scattering into the halls that we entered from.

“It's trapping us,” I said softly.

We brandished the sword and rushed towards the creature. We were intent on stopping it from causing those walls to go down. We didn't plan on leaving until it was dead, but the idea of being trapped in the arena with it horrified us.

Before we could reach it, though, the wall groaned and started to crumble. Thousands of years of dust and debris was kicked into the air as the Guardian achieved its goal and caused the wall to fall into the exit.

No way out.

Okay, well, no problem. Once this beast was dead we could get out on our own time, assuming the light flowers stayed lit.

“We're locked in here!” Wilson cried, backpedaling several steps away from the beast. He was shaking like a leaf, his eyes wide. “I knew this was a terrible idea! We need to find a way out now and come back when we're actually prepared!”

“No!” I shouted back, bristling. “We got this far, this beast will die today!”

“WEBBER, REMEMBER.” WX was beside us now, a cold hand resting on our shoulder as he spoke, staring straight at the Ancient Guardian. “NOTHING IS SOLVED IF YOU PERISH TO THIS CREATURE. IT IS NOT COWARDICE TO BACK OUT WHEN NEEDED.”

“You think we should leave too?” I demanded, trying to keep the betrayal out of our voice. The robot hesitated for a minute.

“NO,” he finally said.

The Guardian shook itself free of the debris, its snuffling breaths echoing in the cavern. It stomped forward a few paces, roaring again as it did so. Its roar was so much quieter than the Bearger's was, but it drive icicles of fear into our heart.

Winona was the first to break away from the shock. With a spear in hand, she met the Guardian's eyes with a fierce determination.

Clearly angered by the action, she became the next target. It didn't rush her. Instead, it slowly, almost carefully, inched closer to her, its expression slowly becoming more and more enraged.

Once it was just a few steps away from her, the Guardian swung at her, its horn glinting faintly in the light of our sword. Just before striking Winona, though, Wilson was there, slashing into the creature's face mercilessly with his knife.

The same knife he had used to blind us.

We struggled to take our eyes away from it.

The Ancient Guardian whipped its head, smashing into Wilson's side with the side of its horn with such force that the scientist was flung away and skidded against the floor. As soon as Wilson had been disengaged, it reared at Winona. The mechanic barely managed to scramble away before facing a similar fate to Wilson, who was grasping his stomach as he struggled to regain his breath.

“ARE YOU NOT GOING TO JOIN THEM?” WX asked. He flourished his arms. “THIS WAS YOUR IDEA.”

We took a deep breath and nodded. “Let's do this together.”

The robot nodded, and we both set off towards the beast.

Its gray ears twitched as if noticing our movement. Its gaze swung away from Winona, one foot stomping furiously against the ground as if hoping the vibrations would shake us off course.

It focused on us first, our black fur glittering in the bright light of our sword and the light flowers.

And it charged.

We ducked away, aiming our sword to slash the beast as it passed.

Instead, the Guardian halted and tore the sword from our hands with its teeth. The weapon clanged uselessly nearby, completely harmless.

Well, fine. We had claws.

We leaped forward, flashing our claws.

Then WX pulled us back before we could land a hit.

“Hey!” I protested angrily, struggling away from him. He let us go immediately after and smashed the blunt end of his spear into its jaw. It shook itself furiously, an opportunity that both Winona and Wilson took advantage of to launch their own attacks.

As soon as neither of us were in danger of being impaled, we growled at the robot. “What was that for?”

“YOU ATTEMPTED TO ATTACK THE BEAST UNARMED,” WX replied, his voice pitching with annoyance. “WHEN ITS GREATEST WEAPON IS ON ITS HEAD.”

Okay, yeah, that was an annoyingly good point. “That doesn't mean anything.”

“FINE,” he huffed. “NEXT TIME YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE IMPALED, I WILL NOT SAVE YOU.”

“Good!” I shot back.

The Guardian was focused on Winona and Wilson, now, so we rushed to retrieve our sword.

Surprisingly, even after smashing against the ground, it was completely intact. We wiped our weak hand off on our fur and raised the sword in our good hand.

The spiders were working effortlessly at its feet, darting in occasionally and tearing away patches of fur. The Guardian seemed annoyed with its arachnid foes, turning its blank gaze away from the two humans attacking it to stomp the spiders into the ground. Most of them were fast enough to escape, but not all were as lucky.

Figuring it was distracted enough, we gripped the sword harder and twisted to meet it from behind.

We felt our heart skip a beat more than once as the Ancient Guardian landed hits on our friends. Winona received a nasty blow to her cheek that was still bleeding, and Wilson had multiple smaller wounds on his arms from moving slightly too slow more than once.

WX had closed it on its other side, making a wide berth around the others as they fought the beast. He looked up and down its body, then dashed in to swipe his weapon at its ear.

It roared, this time in agony, as WX's attack landed. There was a splash of blackened blood, and the gray ear was severed from the Guardian at its base.

We wanted to congratulate WX on the good hit, but the robot had to immediately dodge another attack before landing another vicious hit that severed its other ear.

It was absolutely enraged now.

WX had to scramble away, nearly tripping over himself, as the Guardian attempted to crush the robot into the ground. He was beaming, clearly pleased with himself.

Wilson whooped and Winona threw her first into the air.

WX met our eyes and nodded a single time, as if inviting us to attack with him.

So we did.

Deciding that the sword was too heavy for a quick flurry of attacks, we retrieved our own knife and dropped the sword where we stood. With its furious gaze still set on WX, it didn't notice us until we had plunged the knife into its rough hide. The Guardian roared, bucking us off with such strength that we hit the ground on our side, still clutching the bloody knife.

We started to drag ourself back to our feet, but as we did the Guardian was already over us and smashed the blunt part of its horn into our head.

We tripped on our feet as we walked back a few paces, struggling to blink the stars from our vision.

“You're going to die if you keep doing this.”

“No I won't,” I snapped, holding our head in one hand. We had dropped the knife, and we were having a bit of trouble focusing our vision enough to pick it back up.

Apparently taking notes from WX's attack, Wilson moved from attacking the Guardian's body to attacking the smaller parts of it. Particularly, he aimed for its eye.

He reared his spear back, closing one eye, then threw it with all his might. It would have missed, but the Guardian must have seen movement from the corner of its eye and turned to face it.

It lurched back as the spear buried into its eye with such force that it stuck, no matter how hard it tried to shake it off.

We had to take that advantage, even if we could barely walk in a straight line.

Unfortunately, the Guardian was too furiously shaking itself for us to get a proper hit. It twisted its head and hit us directly in the chest.

We felt our feet leave the ground at the hit. Our heart pounded with terror.

The ground came far too fast. We knew that it was coming and flung out our hand, but it was the bad hand that took the brunt of the damage.

And the agony immediately wiped everything from our mind. As soon as we stopped rolling, we curled ourself around the hand, whimpering and struggling not to pass out.

It happened too fast.

I could've stopped it, if I had just forced myself up despite the pain tearing through my arm. If I had waited to regain my bearings before trying to attack it. If I hadn't begged to come down here to sate some sort of bloodlust that was starting to drive me mad.

It just happened too fast.

Sensing our weakness, the Ancient Guardian had turned its attention towards us. We didn't notice it. All we could think about was how much it hurt why did it hurt it was supposed to be better now why did it hurt so much?!

And so we didn't try to defend ourself when it charged at us.

We looked up, realizing our danger far too late. If we had been at our peak, we might have been able to dodge, but not like this.

The thought hit us so hard that we nearly cried.

We were going to die.

It was going to kill us right here.

And we were going to let it.

“Tyler!”

Something grabbed us, just before the hit came. We were shoved aside, pushed so roughly we hit the ground again and another wave of pain washed over us.

So when we looked up, to see what had happened, we looked up just in time to see it burned in our head forever.

It was WX.

He stood strong, his gaze fierce and his arms wide as if baiting the beast. His face was twisted in a snarl, and he shouted at it so loud his voice hurt our ears.

“COME AND GET IT YOU WORTHLESS BEAST!”

It hit him full speed, its horn angled down and smashing directly into the robot's stomach. The horn cut through metallic skin like it was nothing.

And pierced WX all the way through.

Before we could even truly understand what was happening, WX was flung off of the horn of the beast, his body crashing into one of the stalactites high above before hitting the ground again in a shower of sparks and metal shreds.

He wasn't moving.

“WX?” I whispered hoarsely. I choked on the name, my physically pain suddenly forgotten.

As I said his name, the robot turned his head slightly to look at me, a half-smile on his face.

He was alive!

I rushed to his side, crouching beside him and taking one of his hands in mine, almost unable to believe my own eyes. He turned his gaze down before letting his head fall back again. “WOW,” he murmured under his breath. “I SUPPOSE I LIED.”

“WX... you're badly injured,” I said helplessly. The hole in his stomach wasn't by any means small. In fact, it was so large that it was almost a miracle it hadn't torn him completely in half. I took my hand back and traced the edges of it, wincing every time torn metal ripped through the skin of my fingers. “I don't know what to do. Maybe Winona. Winona can fix you, I know she can.” I stood up, shaking my head furiously to shoo the darkness on the edge of my vision away.

As soon as I did, though, WX reached up and pulled me back down beside him. “NO, PLEASE.” His voice broke. “SHE CAN'T FIX ME, WEBBER. DON'T LET ME DIE ALONE, PLEASE.” His grip tightened so hard that I could feel pins and needles in my fingers.

Who am I? Model WX-78, fleshling.

“You're not going to die!” Even as I said this, I felt tears spilling out of my eyes. “You-you can't die! Robots can't die! We can fix you, I promise!”

“ROBOTS CAN'T DIE. HA...” He shook his head, looking up at the ceiling for a moment. “WELL... MAYBE I'M MORE ALIVE THAN EITHER OF US THOUGHT.” Now that I was in no danger of leaving, he seemed to visibly relax.

“WX...” I murmured. “Please, let me try to help you. I know we can, if we just-”

“WEBBER.” I fell silent, hanging onto his words as if they alone could fix this. “PLEASE, I WANT... I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND... TO KNOW...”

I would have smacked it off but i find it unfair to attack the crippled.

I nodded, trying to focus on him, trying to ignore the tears and the way that they sparked when they landed on him.

“I WAS BUILT... I WAS BUILT TO HATE. TO... HELP ONLY MYSELF. BUT THIS... THIS WORLD...” His gaze landed on mine, and he smiled again. “YOU. GAVE ME SOMETHING MORE. SOMETHING THAT NO AUTOMATON COULD POSSIBLY EVER HAVE.” His voice hitched as another shower of sparks erupted from his stomach. He curled himself slightly, as if trying to protect himself against what was already there. “YOU GAVE ME A FAMILY. YOU GAVE ME A SOUL.”

Invigorating. Like I could outrun death.

“WX, please, save your energy.” I gently touched the torn metal again, struggling desperately to figure out where to start. “I'm no one special. I'm no one at all. Why do you care so much for me that you would d-do this to yourself?”

“WEBBER.”

“WX, please, don't say any more. If you just spare your energy, I can get you out of here. I can get Winona and Wilson to help fix you. You just have to stop- to stop-” I sputtered on the words.

“WEBBER, CAN'T YOU TELL?” His expression fell as his eyeless gaze examined my face. “YOU'RE YOU.”

“No...”

“BUT NOW... I AM DYING.” WX-78 focused on the ceiling now as he spoke. “NOTHING CAN STOP THIS. EVEN IF... IF I WAS STILL INTACT, I AM LOSING ENERGY AT A FAR FASTER RATE THAN I COULD REGENERATE IT.”

“But even- even if you shut off, we can still fix you and bring you back, right? R-right?”

WX reached up, his cold hand surprisingly gentle as he used his thumb to brush away the tears under my eye. “YOU KNOW THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.”

The hound would not stop barking.

I nodded, screwing my eyes shut and finally failing to keep my composure.

I curled myself over him, my forehead against his chest, and started to sob. It was more than what I had done when Wilson died, and more than I had done when I had been stabbed, smashed, blinded, betrayed, crushed. My entire body shook, and my breaths were short and hitched, punctuated by high pitched whimpers and choked inhales. “Why, WX? Why did you do this?” I cried. “Not you, please, anyone but you...”

I trembled as his hand rested on my head, gently petting my fur as if that could help anything.

“OH, WEBBER... PLEASE DON'T CRY. YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO STRONG.”

I held him tighter and cried harder. I felt his hand, gradually losing its cold bite, pet the top of my head lightly again. I didn't want him to see me like this, but I couldn't hold it back.

I will not apologize for trying to help... but I should apologize for failing to do so.

I wrapped my arms around him and clung to him, holding him in a desperate hug that I tried to pour everything out in. My pain, my guilt, the way that I had really started to see him as family.

That's what he was. He was my family. My closest companion. My oldest rival.

Whatever he said, I promise it was a lie.

“WILSON AND WINONA NEED YOU MORE THAN EVER. AND YOU WON'T FAIL THEM.” I slowly dragged myself back up to see his face again as he spoke. His words were becoming slurred. “I KNOW YOU WON'T.”

“WX...” I shook my head and clenched my teeth. “I'm no one special. I'm just... I'm just a stupid kid.”

He turned his head away. When he spoke, his voice was so soft that I could barely hear him. “YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT, DON'T YOU?”

I had to speak through a mountain of rubble. It felt like it was choking me, suffocating me, forever casting me into the darkness...

“We could have been... such great friends.”

His words were so faint, so blurred, that I barely even understood them. “I THOUGHT WE ALREADY WERE.”

I forced myself to smile for him, so that he could see something, anything positive, in these last moments. “I... I thought so too.”

And softly, ever so softly, I heard the smallest of off-key notes as he began to sing.

“THE ITSY BITSY SPIDER…”

I suppose it is a good thing that I am neither human nor spider.

“WENT UP THE WATER SPOUT…”

Am I speaking to a spider right now, or a human?

“DOWN CAME THE RAIN…”

Then why am I not happy?

“AND WASHED THE SPIDER OUT.”

I would rather die a hero than live to become a villain.

“OUT CAME THE SUN AND… DRIED UP ALL THE RAIN…”

“And the itsty… bitsy spider went up the spout again.” I barely managed to choke out the words, but I needed to. I absolutely had to.

Because I couldn’t bear to let his song go unfinished.

I covered my mouth and ducked my head into my chest, but even that was barely enough to muffle the wail of pain that I could no longer hold back.

“Please, get up, WX. Please don't do this. Don't- don't, don't be gone. I can't... you were... please, please...” I screwed my eyes shut, and pressed my forehead against his chest. The sobs that tore from my chest ripped apart everything on their way out until my heart was in shreds and my throat was raw.

I wasn't sure how long it was until the sounds of the battle returned to my ears.

I wasn't sure how long it was until I heard Erika whispering to me, promising that they would keep the Ancient Guardian away.

I wasn't sure how long it was until the tears stopped coming.

Or how long it took for the sobs to subside.

Or how long it took for me to finally be able to tear my gaze away from the body of my best friend.

“Tyler, we can end this.” A voice whispered in my head. “We can end it.”

I had spent so long refusing to give into the spider's demands. So long refusing to let him have any control.

Quite frankly, I was tired of playing nice.

It was as though my body was on autopilot. I stumbled forward, lifting the glowing sword in my good hand.

“You're right,” I whispered. “I failed this fight. It's your turn.”

The Ancient Guardian was certainly occupied with the spiders, Wilson, and Winona. The crushed corpses of several spiders lay at its feet, but somehow, more kept appearing, urged on by their leader. Wilson and Winona were playing far too much with fire, coming too close to being hit more than once.

Next time you are about to be impaled, I will not save you.

I twitched ever so slightly, a fire burning in my gut. I brought the sword up and smashed its tip into the ground. The sound was surprisingly loud, demanding the attention of everyone in the room, including the Guardian.

I tipped my chin at it and bared my teeth.

Which was all it took.

It charged at me, a muted roar coming from his mouth. It had dislodged the spear in its eye, but the injured eye was closed and bleeding profusely. It had several other bleeding wounds, including the severed ears, but it was acting as though it was completely unharmed.

Not for long.

Instead of trying to scramble out of the way to dodge, I ducked between the beast's feet, and pointed my sword straight in the air.

The Ancient Guardian's momentum was its downfall.

It fell hard and skidded. I expected, almost wanted, to see blood pouring out of the wound, but there was none. Instead, black smoke poured from its stomach and eyes, and writhed around the sword. Almost as though satisfied, the smoke buried itself into the sword's blade. In response, its glow increased, and the bright blue turned a shade darker.

But the Ancient Guardian was still alive.

No.

I refuse to let this happen.

With a roar, I fell towards the Guardian, relentlessly slashing its bloody hide over and over and over again. The sword made no wounds, instead passing harmlessly through its body as if it was water. Without visible wounds, I couldn't even stop myself as I pressed harder and harder, swung faster and faster.

It wasn't me, and I knew it wasn't. I didn't stand this way, or snarl this way. Despite my promises, I had completely allowed the spider to take me over. To tip me into that same darkness that had consumed me every other time we had fought some sort of monster.

We were supposed to have more training.

Slash.

We were supposed to wait until next Spring.

Slash.

This wouldn't have happened if I hadn't gotten hurt.

Slash.

This was my fault.

Slash.

It was all my fault.

Abruptly, I was wrenched away from my prey, the sword clattering harmlessly as it fell from my hand. I let out a howl of despair. No!! I was not going to let anyone or anything stop me from erasing this creature from the face of the planet!

I tried to tear myself away, to finish what I had started, but I felt a hand press against my back and another around my neck, just strong enough to keep me in place.

Suddenly exhausted, I fell into the person holding me. I could tell without looking that it was Winona, and whether she was actually trying to calm me or just trying to stop me from brutally murdering the Ancient Guardian was beyond me.

Either way, I needed that hold.

I grabbed onto her and sobbed until I couldn't breathe. I cried and cried and cried until I could think about nothing else except for my pain, my loss. What else could I possibly even think about? Less than an hour ago, my best friend had been alive. I didn't have time to tell him anything that I needed to say.

That I, too, was sorry for how we started.

That he was my best friend.

That he was the only one I truly trusted anymore.

And now, I could never tell him any of that.

Because he died for me. For me.

“How badly is he injured?” Winona asked softly. I felt my muscles stiffen and I choked out another sob. I shook my head and buried my face in her shoulder.

“Too much,” I hissed. My voice was hoarse. “He's- he's- he's gone.”

“Wilson, give us a heads up if that thing gets back up or tries anything, okay? I think WX-78 is going to need some intense repairs.”

I barely looked up enough to see Wilson. He didn't seem to respond to Winona for a long moment. Instead, he was staring at me, his face creased into a deep frown. He looked as if he wanted to say something, but he only looked away and nodded.

Winona gently took my arm and brought me back to my feet. I could barely hold myself up, and she seemed to know that. She kept one arm around my shoulder, supporting me enough to stand.

“We saw him get hit,” she said softly. “But I think we both figured the best thing to do was keep the Guardian occupied. Wilson was terrified.”

“Can... can you fix him?” I winced at the hopefulness in my voice. How easily could I convince myself of the impossible?

Winona smiled at me. “Well, I wouldn't be a mechanic if I didn't try, now would I?”

It took all of my effort not to break down again as Winona settled beside the fallen body of my best friend. Even then, fresh tears still leaked from my eyes and I couldn't look at him.

I heard Winona hiss under her breath, as if she hadn't realized the extent of the damage until now. I was shaking again- why was I shaking again?

“Tyler, it's okay. This is... grief.”

Why is it so painful? It didn't feel like this when Wilson died. I just felt... so empty.

But... please, I don't understand. Why does it feel like I can't breathe? Like everything is crushing me? Webber, please... I dragged myself away, turning my back to Winona. I curled my arms over my stomach and hung my head, silently pleading for the spider's help. Please help me... please... make it stop hurting.

“I can't do that, Tyler. This isn't something you can just shake off. And this isn't something I can shake off for you. The Ancient Guardian isn't dead, but it is incapacitated. And it should be until you decide what you want to do with it. If you need my help with it, then I will help you. But this is something we can get through.”

“Webber.” I flinched at Winona's voice. No, it was the tone of her voice. I knew what she was going to say before she could say it.

“Don't, I-”

“I'm sorry, Webber.” She lowered herself to her knees beside me. She reached over and took my hand, then placed an object in it. I turned my eyes to the object she had given me.

It was... a metallic box. Small, small enough that I could hold it effortlessly in one hand without fear of dropping it, but inherently intricate. It was borderline destroyed, large pieces having been torn apart from it. Half of the inside had clearly been gutted, exposing more wires and boards than I could possibly even understand. I choked again as she spoke, and it took all of my strength not to drop it.

“This... um... this, I think, is what allowed him to... live. His heart, almost. It would have stored and recycled energy as he moved... which is why he didn't need any power source. If it was intact...” She hesitated, then shook her head and covered part of it with her hand. “Without it, it's impossible to fix him. Even if you did... if you gave him some sort of external power source...”

“It wouldn't be him,” I said softly. He had said that himself. It couldn't happen. At worst, he would never even be able to wake up. At best, he would be completely reverted back to the way he was built.

Nothing but ones and zeroes.

“I'm sorry,” Winona said again. “I... I didn't get the extent of your relationship with him, but I know you were close.”

“He was my best friend,” I murmured. As she dropped her hand away, I covered the box with my lame one, unwilling to see it but unwilling to part with it. “He was my brother.”

“Uh, guys? Guardian alert? It's moving?” Wilson's voice snapped us both out of what felt like an eternity of silence. My gaze shot up, fixing immediately on the aforementioned beast. I instinctively went for the sword before remembering how entirely useless it was, so I shifted my hand to my knife. I placed the box ever so gently on the ground and stumbled forward.

This beast was going to die no matter what.

It had struggled to its feet, and there was something distinctly different about it. Nothing noticed by me, but rather noticed by the spider, who was almost forcing me to take note of the changes.

“It's fur is no longer gray. Rather, it's closer to a pale orange, or more like a tan. It's skin looks healthier and, well, alive, rather than the sort of stony look it had before. It has pupils. It's moving entirely differently, slowly and meticulously. Almost like it is thinking about moving? Yes, it's definitely intelligent. Definitely thinking.”

“Webber,” Wilson warned, but he seemed hesitant to near me. Good for him. I would not have hesitated to put him in his grave if he dared to interfere with me.

“You killed him!” I howled. “Why him!? Why did it have to be him!?”

I expected no answer.

Which is why I nearly fell at getting one.

“Young Heir.” Its voice was so deep, but smooth. Its words didn't come from its mouth, but I could hear them in my head as clearly as if they did. “The Darkness takes many victims. Your friend is not the first, and it will not be the last.”

“It wasn't any darkness or monster,” I spat. “He was just trying to protect me. He was- he was-” I had to screw my eyes shut. I couldn't even speak properly. How weak could I possibly be?

My anger was crumbling. My resolve was failing.

I just wanted to go home.

“Their presence has faded. The beast has lost one of its heads, but it has many more.”

“What are you?” Wilson demanded. His voice broke. “No, it doesn't matter. You have to die. We need that horn.” I idly wondered if he positioned himself into a fighting stance or if he shrunk back in fear. “And- and we will get it, no matter what. Even if we have to cut it off.”

“Ah, The Host. A man who stumbled upon a fraying world in pursuit of knowledge but found something more. A man who fancied himself a recluse, who hid from the world and swore that he needed no one, yet a man who dies slightly every single day because of his actions against another- one whose blood he does not share, but who means just as much to him as if he did. A man whose soul is slowly crumbling, even as he holds up a facade of strength. The Gentleman Scientist, a broken shell that will never be whole again.”

I looked up, eyeing Wilson carefully. The expressions behind his eyes were unreadable, flashing between a million different emotions before finally settling into something blank and unsure.

“And The Sister. A woman who sacrificed everything- her home, her friends, her life- in a desperate attempt to save the one she loved from a broken man. A woman who wold do anything to protect and save the one she shared a womb with, but who believed herself to have failed. She finds herself in the midst of darkness, running from a monster that only wants to give her answers. Fleeing from the same beast that she came here seeking. The Handywoman, a sibling who has succeeded in her one goal in life... but has a much bigger task ahead.”

Winona wrapped her arms around herself, her eyes flickering over the deep shadows that edged the room. “Charlie is here?” She whispered.

“The Martyr. Born to hate and be hated. A machine built to fill a void that could never be filled. A machine who came to a blackened land to flee from his past, from his mistakes, and from his purpose. A machine who fought, every second of every day, to become something more, but forever afraid that he would fail. Ones and zeroes, that is all he believed himself to be until the very end, where he was finally gifted his humanity and soul. The Soulless Automaton, truly no more.”

My breath hitched at the Guardian's words. I expected to be angrier, but the way that it spoke was so solemn, so... broken... I couldn't. The Ancient Guardian was grieving for the very person he killed.

“The One True Heir. An animal whose presence does not grace us today... but whose destiny is growing ever closer. The first, and one day the last. Birthed and raised in darkness with a heart spoiled with hatred. An animal who learned to love, but far too late. An animal who lost everything, everyone, because of broken promises and bloody deals. He roams aimlessly, his heart empty, his eyes hollow, waiting for the day that his only and oldest friend returns to him. The Monkey King, an empty heart that longs to be complete.”

“There's someone else,” I whispered.

Finally, I froze as the Guardian's eyes landed on me. Its gaze was soulful, pitying and grieving all at once. When it spoke, its voice was low, careful, as if concerned about what its words would do to me.

“And, of course... The Young Heir. A boy marked by Them, whose fate is cast in shadow. A hybrid who spent many late nights on his knees, praying until his throat turned dry and his words turned sour that he would be found. That he would be found, loved, accepted. A boy who struggles to be the strongest, but wants nothing more than a family again. A boy born to a family that he knows no more, whose angry faces haunt him every night as he remembers the last time he laid eyes on them. A boy who fights and struggles in a futile attempt to get a happy future that he was never destined to have. Rather, his future falls into darkness... as his future lies sitting on the very Throne that has cast him into this Hell. The Indigestible, a cursed title for the cursed child destined to rule over a world of shadows- the Constant.”

Ice crawled through my veins. I instinctively retreated into myself, pulling my limbs close to try to chase the chill away.

A child.

A pawn.

A king.

“You're wrong,” I whispered. “Destined to rule? Impossible.” A laugh erupted from my chest- a raw, rough one that tore my throat on its way out. “My destiny has always been to die. And if it weren't for...” I clasped my hands. “If it weren't for WX...” My voice cracked, betraying my youth.

“Young Heir,” the Guardian said softly. “Your words come from a broken place, but your eyes cannot see the future. It is not a future of peace, but it is inevitable.”

“We're not staying long enough for that to happen,” Wilson snapped. I winced, almost forgetting the others were there. “Because all we need is your horn and the eye of the Deerclops, and our freedom is secured.”

“Shame... that such a brilliant group of Survivors is caught by the very same lies and deception that have killed everyone before you.” The Ancient Guardian drew itself up, its eyes moving between each of us carefully, as if trying to find something inside of each of us. “The Dragonfly, the Moose, the Bearger... all innocent creatures. Creatures who lived peaceful lives, but were unfortunate victims of the Nightmare Captor's schemes.”

It paused, as if allowing for the words to sink in.

Innocent creatures.

Innocent creatures.

“My friends... you have been fooled.”

It was crumbling. I felt my knees give, my hands grasping the stone. It felt like the cave was collapsing around us.

It was Winona who broke the silence, actually, as the only one who hadn't suffered through the fights. Through the injuries. Through watching her only parental figure perish.

“If this isn't the answer, then what is?” She demanded. “I don't know the extent of everything, but I do know that- that my friends have gone through a lot to get here. Are you telling us that was all for nothing?”

The Guardian looked thoughtful, then lowered its head slightly.

“Doors go both ways.” Faint quivers of terror continued to wrack my body long after we had left the Ancient Guardian's chamber behind. I wasn't one to pray, but I couldn't help but thank whatever higher power, benevolent or not, for not making the outcome so much worse.

Heavy silence had fallen over us, the sort of silence that felt like a sin to break.

It had been a struggle to leave the chamber behind, both mentally and physically. The collapsed wall made for an annoying obstacle, although one passed easily enough when not being pursued by a rhino demon monster.

I couldn't help but glance over at Winona, cradling Webber in her arms. The boy had all but crashed, his body simply incapable of handling the trauma he had suffered. I had wanted nothing more than to scoop him up and comfort him myself, but he was scared of me. Terrified. I wasn't going to make this any worse than it had to be.

Rather, he had pressed himself into Winona's hold, shivering and shaking and sobbing until he had cried himself out. Even now, unconscious as he was, his lone eye was puffy and his furry face was matted into damp clumps.

Winona caught me looking and frowned. “Wilson... don't beat yourself up about this.”

“He was my friend, Winona.” I hadn't been as close to the robot as Webber, but that didn't mean I didn't care for him. The three of us had been through too much together to not consider each other friends. Webber had called us family. I sighed, raising a hand and running it through my hair. Under my breath, I cursed myself for my stupidity. My heartlessness. “It was for nothing.”

“No,” Winona protested. “It wasn't for nothing. The Ancient Guardian gave you information that you would never have had otherwise. This was... a tragedy...” Winona glanced down at the boy in her arms for just a second. “This shouldn't have happened... but from what I knew of him, I promise that WX-78 would not have wanted either of you to be discouraged. He saved Webber,” she added gently. “That was his choice. He knew he was going to die, and he did it anyway. It would only be a disservice to him to do anything else but continue forward.”

There was a moment of suffocating silence. I wanted to say something, but I couldn't come up with anything to say. I didn't want to tarnish WX's memory, but...

What would he rather I do? Continue towards our goal? Try to puzzle out the Guardian's cryptic “Doors go both ways” comment?

Or keep Webber safe, the way he had died doing?

Because we couldn't do both.

I had begun to make peace with the idea that leaving, that going home, was fruitless. We had lived here for a year, now. It was almost tempting to just abandon the idea of going home ever. To stay forever in this makeshift Hell just to preserve what little life we had left.

I felt like that wasn't an idea the others would appreciate, so I didn't mention it. But it was always there now. I shook my head, confused yet unwilling to break the spell of silence we had fallen under again.

And so, Winona took it upon herself to break it. “Wilson... what the Ancient Guardian said about us.”

I winced. This was the furthest from a discussion I wanted to have.

“Why did he call you 'The Host'?”

I shrugged, trying to come off as loose and calm but it probably only served to highlight my discomfort. “Ah... maybe it's best we don't talk about that. It's a long story, anyway.”

“We still have awhile to go before we're back,” Winona pointed out.

I debated brushing it off and telling her to drop it, but I glanced quickly at Webber and decided against it. “I hurt him,” I said softly. “No... Nightmare hurt him. He just used me to do it.” I shook my head. “So... the 'Host' of Nightmare, I'm assuming. Hah... what a title to be remembered by, right?” Winona still looked confused, but before she could ask the obvious question, I jumped in. “I don't know what Nightmare is. It's... some sort of demon, I know. Something with a vendetta against Webber, and apparently some sort of past. Nothing that I know about. What about you?” I pushed in hopes of getting the attention away from me. “It sounded like it was saying...”

Winona nodded, keeping her eyes decidedly away. “That my sister is here? I've not stopped thinking about it... is she alive? Is she alright? Where is she? I don't know, Wilson, I really didn't trust that thing. Especially since...”

Ah, the elephant in the room.

“It called Webber the Young Heir?” I guessed.

“Saying that he's destined to quite literally be the King of the World?” Winona scoffed. “No way. I'm not saying that he's weak, but he's so... small.” He shifted slightly in her arms as though aware we were talking about him, but Winona paid him no attention. “I think it'd be best if we just took everything it said with a grain of salt. That long in the shadows can't be good for your noggin, right?”

“But don't you want to see your sister again? Wouldn't it be a good thing if she was here?”

Winona cast her gaze down. “I... don't know. Do you remember what it said? 'She finds herself in the midst of darkness, running from a monster that only wants to give her answers. Fleeing from the same beast that she came here seeking.' What does that mean for Charlie? Is she the beast that it was talking about?” She paused. “Maybe I should've just... continued with my life like the rest of my family.”

“No,” I responded immediately. “Just because everyone else gave up doesn't mean you have to, too. We'll find her, Winona.”

She gave me the smallest of smiles from the corner of her mouth. “Thank you, Wilson.”

“Hey.” I paused in my step, forcing Winona to do the same. She tipped her head at me. “Listen. You shouldn't think that you have to thank us for something like that. You are one of us now, and... well, there's nothing much else we can do, right?” I chewed at the inside of my cheek, looking past Winona's shoulder and into the darkness. “After all... it sounds like we're kinda stuck here for now.”

She reached out a hand and placed it on my shoulder. The strength of her grip surprised me. “Let's get back home, and then we can discuss this more. Once Webber is up to it.”

“Right...” It was optimistic, really, thinking that Webber would be up to talking any time soon. I would be surprised if he even woke up in the next three days. I think we all needed some good rest at that point.

God, I was exhausted.

“Wilson.” Winona snapped her fingers in front of my eyes, forcing me back to reality. “Let's get moving before the lantern is out. No use in letting ourselves die too, right?”

I couldn't argue with that. Maybe I would also have more luck thinking once we all got some sleep... and some time to recover. We were all injured to some degree, and some down time to heal both physically and mentally was more important than anything else right now.

I nodded at her, and once again took the lead. “I warned you.”

Even in my dreams, my head throbbed dully. Old tears stained my face, but for now, no new ones rose to add to them. I curled my arms around myself and looked away, unwilling to make eye contact with the arachnid who chose to haunt my dreams.

“Get away from me.” My voice was low, lame. Completely emotionless and flat, rendering the typical anger of those words entirely moot.

“You are still blaming me? You know you are kidding yourself. Just because you want to pretend that this is someone else's fault doesn't make it so.”

I lifted my gaze to glare down at the spider. A heavy moment passed, and he sighed, his accusing eyes softening ever-so-slightly.

“You will only continue to hurt yourself if you deny that, Tyler. Besides, however untimely your friend's death was, there is much to be gained from it. After all, I believe that the Ancient Guardian provided you with some helpful information, did he not?”

Once again, I turned my eyes down. “Shut up.”

He growled, clearly irritated now. “Ignoring what you know helps absolutely no one! Besides, Tyler, what does it matter? Your companions are nothing in the grand scheme of the world. Nothing at all like you. You are destined for the Throne! What a legacy! In the end, none of this matters. None of them matter. All that matters is that of which is immortal now. Nothing but you and I and Them, for as long as eternity lasts.”

“Stop,” I snapped. Anger was quietly starting to boil up from the pit of my stomach. The only emotion that felt safe to feel right now. “Just... stop talking. I don't want that. I- I don't-” A sharp intake of breath came in as a hiccup. A dry sob.

“It doesn't matter what you want anymore. Once you take your throne, you can have everything you want, for however long you want it.” The spider paused, tapping a clawed leg thoughtfully. “Well, except perhaps freedom from Them. But Tyler, think about it.” He grinned. “With the power of the Nightmare Captor... you can do anything in this world. You can walk the streets of your old home as a god, worshiped and feared by every single person who shunned you. You can make them pay for every rock, every piece of debris they threw at you. You can make your family immortal beside you. You can bring WX-78 back to life.”

A shiver rose up my spine, and for a moment, I almost lost my balance. I leaned forward slightly to remain on my feet, one hand resting against my knee as I did so. “I... what?”

“What do you think happened to Wilson? Who else would have the power to revive a soul, especially one who died so brutally?” He leaned forward as well, although in anticipation rather than shock and confusion. “Why stop at him, though? Why not think bigger?” He turned around so that his back was facing me. He started to walk away, but he paused just long enough to say one more thing. “Why don't you bring Erika back to the way she used to be?”

Something snapped. I lunged forward desperately, trying to stop him from disappearing. “Wait!”

But he was already gone, leaving me alone to fall fully onto my knees. I wrapped my arms around myself and blinked emptily at the ground beneath me.

I could bring my sister back, to the way she was before she was killed and reborn into a spider. Shakily, I raised my hands and stared at them- furless, human, as always in my dreams.

I could go back to the way I used to be.

But, I argued internally. At what cost? My sanity? My hope? My freedom? What would I have to give up to take the Throne? Would I even be myself anymore at all?

Would I even want any of those things anymore?

“You know, I can't stop thinking about that hint it gave you.”

My heart skipped a beat in my chest as I heard the spider speak up from somewhere behind me. I didn't turn to face him, but I listened nonetheless.

“'Doors go both ways'. What a peculiar thing to say. After all, I can't for the life of me remember a door.”

I raised my hand and turned my palm upwards. The scar was still there. It always was. The very scar that I had given myself over a year ago now, in a desperate attempt to regain everything I had lost. I still remembered my wish, too.

Even as I thought it, the memory swelled over me, so harshly and suddenly that I felt as if I was there again. So scrawny that I could see my ribs even through my fur, hungry enough for it to hurt, and bleeding from multiple wounds of varying ages that refused to heal. How could they heal? I couldn't even sleep at night and barely ate enough to keep myself alive. I had grabbed the soft ground beneath me, my body heaving with sobs. For the last time, I told myself. I would never cry again, if I could just get it out now and steel myself against any other reasons to cry in the future.

I had never seen Maxwell in person. I had felt him, had sensed him, but he hadn't come to me in any physical form.

“You're so much... smaller than I imagined. Little more than a toddler.”

I never looked up. Not once.

“What do you want?”

His voice had been strangely soft.

“I... I just want my family back.”

“That wouldn't be too hard. I would be more than willing to help you if you are willing to help me. I just need you to help me... build a simple door.”

“If only,” the spider tutted, a sneer evident in the way he spoke. “If only I had any clue what door it was talking about.” Death always seemed to drain something out of people. Perhaps it was the strange definition of death in this world? No matter who the person had been in life, falling at the hands of the shadows always crippled them. Whenever Charlie appeared to retrieve the newly fallen ex-Survivor, they would be dazed and quiet. Their eyes would be distant, confused. And they would never fight her. A few times, having observed the Survivors long enough, Charlie worried that they would fight. More than once she considered bringing Nightmare to such retrievals, if only for a protective measure. However, she had stopped even considering it after some time. If someone as supposedly ferocious as the self-appointed Valkyrie or the oft misguidedly defensive strongman didn't have the strength or wits to attack her, she doubted anyone would.

Although, on second thought, maybe she should've continued to keep her defenses up.

Charlie saw him long before he saw her, but she could see the way he stiffened up as if sensing her presence. The second she stepped out of the shadows and made her presence known, she was on the receiving end of a rather vicious punch.

She had to take a couple of steps back in order to regain her balance. Before the newly deceased robot could attack her again, she waved a hand a summon twin lengths of chains that sprouted from the ground and clasped around his wrists. She didn't like to use force, but she was also kind of afraid of being beaten senseless. He said nothing, but he did struggle at the restraints for a moment before resigning himself to simply glaring at her... although, if looks could kill, Charlie would be just as alive as he was.

“Be thankful,” Charlie murmured. “That I didn't bring Nightmare along. There would be nothing left of your soul.”

He shrunk back, although not in submission or fear. Rather, it looked like he was coiling, preparing himself to snap forward like a snake.

“Listen,” she sighed. “I'm... just as unhappy about this as you are. But I am not your enemy. Come with me without fighting, and we might be able to save what little is left of you.”

“I REFUSE TO BE A PART OF YOUR GAME,” the robot snapped, bristling. “LET ME DIE.”

“Well,” Charlie started with a shrug. “You are dead, if that makes you feel better. At least... as close to death as you can come in this world.”

He continued to glare at her.

“You should know very well it's impossible to bring someone back from death. Luckily the Constant is very forgiving about it. Instead of 'dying' in a traditional sense, your body and soul became weak enough to cross the barriers. Landing you here.” She flourished her hands, beckoning to the dark landscape around them. “So, no, I can't just let you die. That would break the rules of the Game. Besides, if you completely disappeared, you would have no chance of coming back, would you?”

“AS IF I HAVE A CHANCE NOW?”

“Actually, you do.” Charlie smiled softly. “Once Webber takes the Throne, bringing you back is the first thing he will do. Then, it'll be his sister.”

This time, the robot physically recoiled. A flash of uncertainty passed over his face. “HE WOULDN'T. NOT FOR ME.”

“It's not like he can fight that destiny. I suppose he could have, if you hadn't taken that hit for him. But you did, and he survived that battle.”

At that, his choice seemed to weigh on him. He looked tired, more beaten down, more like what was expected of someone who had just brutally died.

“TAKE ME TO MAXWELL,” he finally said. By the tone of his voice, it was a demand, not a request. Then again, that had been exactly what Charlie was supposed to do in the first place.

As the manacles around his wrists disappeared, Charlie prepared herself to be attacked again. Instead, the robot stumbled over himself as if surprised that he had actually been released. He shot an distrustful glare Charlie's way, but she paid no mind to it.

Neither one of them spoke, instead settling on a crisp silence unbroken by wind or animals. In its place was the rhythmic taps of Charlie's feet on the cool marble. Even the robot's footsteps were completely silent, a far cry from what was normal for him.

The narrow hall of darkness suddenly opened up. Torches blossomed to light as Charlie stepped into the Throne room. They were surrounded on all sides by glowing white eyes, blinking and wavering just on the edge of perception. Charlie chose not to pay any attention to Them, having grown quite used to Their presence. Instead, she fixed her gaze on the red eyes of Nightmare, standing just out of the flickering light.

“Maxwell,” Charlie greeted coolly, dropping to one knee in front of the Nightmare Throne. Maxwell had one leg thrown over the other, and a thoughtful hand on his chin. Charlie could see the shadowy binds, pulling any parts of him not in direct contact towards the surface of the Throne.

The Nightmare Captor regarded them both coldly. The robot, for his part, stood stiffly under the piercing glare, almost as if challenging Maxwell to make a move. Maxwell said nothing, only leaned back a moment later, appearing utterly bored by this game.

Charlie could see the shift in the shadows as Nightmare took in the prisoner. Its presence swelled, its palpable rage boiling until the room felt icy.

“What. Is. That?” The demon snarled. One by one, the torches around them flickered out and died, allowing Nightmare full control to slip out of the darkness. The robot continued to stand against it, but even he had to take a step backward as they were plunged into inky blackness. Charlie could sense his fear.

“Leave it, Nightmare,” Maxwell said breezily. He waved a hand as if shooing Nightmare away, which only caused it to anger further.

“This is not the spider!” Nightmare roared. The beast moved around the robot, a calculating glare taking in every detail of his body as if hoping that he would suddenly turn into the Young Heir. While likely completely blind in the darkness, the robot could clearly sense its presence. Remaining standing was a sheer act of defiance at this point. One that had to take a massive amount of courage.

“He took the hit,” Charlie said.

“The heir was not supposed to survive that battle,” Nightmare growled. “His path leads him directly to the fifth now.” Its claws curled into a fist, as if it was crushing another orb in the world between worlds. “We should have kept him far away from that cursed creature. Let both of their lives crumble into emptiness.”

“The One True Heir can't climb out of what you did to him, even with Webber's help,” Charlie responded, an underlying layer of ice slicing through her words. “In case you forgot, you murdered the mother of his child in cold blood, and made him watch. I don't think you have to worry about any uprising from him for a very long time.”

“That boy is too much like his daughter. If anyone can pull him out of his insanity, it is him.”

“Nightmare,” Maxwell interrupted. “You are dismissed.”

The demon bristled, clearly enraged at being cast aside so easily, but bound by the rules to obey its master, Nightmare slinked past Charlie and the robot and disappeared into the darkness. As it did, the lights flared back to life, and the robot blinked several times as if adjusting to the brightness. He kept his mouth shut, though, much to his credit.

Charlie let her shoulders hang, her defenses wearing down quickly in front of the Nightmare Captor. “I'm tired,” she confessed with a sigh.

“As we all are,” Maxwell agreed. His eyes flickered to the robot, who was doing a very good impression of someone who was not listening, even though he definitely was.

“If he ever returns, it'll be after our reigns,” Charlie pointed out. “Ignore him.”

“Everything is falling into place nicely,” Maxwell said. “Though, I wish it didn't take nearly this long. He has his eyes set on the Throne?”

“I can't say entirely, but that spider is doing a very good job of convincing him.”

Maxwell nodded approvingly. “And you will make sure that he finds his way to the archipelago?”

The robot visibly perked up at this, his interest piqued.

“Yes, of course.”

“Good.” Maxwell leaned back, humming thoughtfully. “Now that the opening act is finally completed, it is time for the real show to begin.”

Chapter 53. No Lullaby

 

 

Webber's POV

We were exhausted, and far lonelier than we had ever felt before. In fact, the only company comfortable with us was actually a trio of animals.

Popsicle hated WX- since the day we adopted him, he had growled or barked at the robot every time he came near. The hound seemed to tolerate him only for our sake. Yet, even then, he seemed to understand our grief, and never wanted to leave our side. More than once, Popsicle had attempted to bring us food- uncleaned and uncooked, the only way a hound knew how to eat- but we had turned him away. Even the decent food, like what Wilson or Winona carefully offered us, never seemed to go down well and would sit in our stomach like a rock for hours.

Chester was the definition of indifference. He rarely interacted with us and often stayed away from the fire and home during exploration. It seemed the strange creature had little mind past staying alive day-to-day, and little interest in games or play. However, he had stayed glued to our lap, oftentimes occupying the space when Popsicle wasn't.

Pyrite was less interested in us and, as always, more interested in Popsicle. She stuck close to him, her warmth welcome compared to the frosty blue fur of the hound. She was the one taking most of Popsicle's food offerings, burning them to ash before happily slurping it up. At least it wasn't going to waste.

The worst part, though, what made all of this so cripplingly lonely, was how Winona and Wilson treated us. Wilson had thankfully kept himself arms distance from us. He never looked us in the eye and spoke to us through Winona instead of directly. While his presence caused us to curl into a visceral defense, the idea that he was no longer even trying hurt. Winona was clearly nervous and unsure of how to speak to us. She wasn't purposely ignoring us, that we knew, but it was as though she could never come up with what to say.

We ran our good hand through our fur, tugging at clumps formed by the salty spray of the ocean without much care. Even amongst the animals, the only one who would follow us this far was Popsicle, who was contently cleaning our fur with his tongue. Here, this close to the ocean, the battering waves viciously chased away other sounds and thoughts.

We inched slightly closer to the edge. Not near enough to risk falling, but enough to jostle Popsicle from his cleaning and catch his attention.

“We all took a plunge from this cliff once,” I said softly, gazing over the water. “In the middle of winter. I couldn't believe we survived it...”

Popsicle twitched slightly and let out a low rumble in response.

“That was only one of the times we almost died, you know,” I continued with a soft chuckle. “It was always something. It still is always something. Giants, evil trees, plunges into freezing water. We were always either sick or injured... WX said that there was no way we would survive past the first season. They were always looking out for us.” Our voice dropped to a soft whisper. “But we never did the same for them. They both...”

They both died. Once because we weren't fast enough to stop it, and once because he gave his life for ours.

A hiccuping sob rose in our throat, something that took all of our effort to swallow back.

“They both died, Popsicle!” I cried. “Because we were too slow, too weak. WX is dead.” Even saying the words out loud, we couldn't believe it. Even though we had watched him die, had held him as he passed, we couldn't believe it. Even though we had held his heart in our hands, we didn't believe it. We pushed ourselves up and paced closer to the edge of the cliff. Popsicle whined softly behind us. “Are you happy now, Maxwell!?” I shouted to the sky. Maybe, just maybe, if I could scream loud enough, the wicked man would be able to hear me from his Throne. “He's dead, and I'm completely helpless! Go ahead Maxwell! Do your worst to me! Do everything that he stopped you from doing before!”

There was no response. Nothing to suggest he even heard, or that he cared.

I fell to my knees and screamed.

When my voice turned hoarse and raw, it turned to heaving, dry sobs. Every fresh batch of tears tore something from me, ripped me apart from the inside until everything about me was laid bare for the world to see. It wasn't just for WX. It was for Wilson and Winona. For every Survivor that had been willed into this cruel game for Maxwell's amusement. For my innocence, long since taken away from me. For who I used to be. For all of the things that I had forced myself to hold back, every time I had swallowed back tears or shoved my pain down. I cried for my scars and wounds, for my missing eye and lame hand. I cried for my sister, murdered and consumed because of my own childish curiosity.

When finally, after what felt like an entire season, I had nothing left to cry for, I finally, finally fell silent. My outburst had all but hollowed me out completely, leaving me little more than what I appeared on the outside. I was nothing more, absolutely nothing more, than a child. So young, too young, for any of this. For just a moment, I let myself imagine. Let myself feel like the child I was. I allowed myself to pretend, just for that one, singular moment, that I was a normal eight-year old, with a bright future to look ahead to. Someone who was destined to live peacefully, married to the love of my life with a family of my own instead of being destined to rot for eternity on a throne of shadows.

But that moment passed quickly enough, and I shoved those thoughts somewhere deep inside, where I would hopefully never see them again.

Slowly, almost painfully, I dragged myself back again, unwilling to look at the ferocious waves any longer. Popsicle, standing by our side during the entire breakdown, inched towards us and gently rested his head on our lap.

“There's really no point, is there, Popsicle?” Our voice was destroyed, barely more than a whisper. “Our destiny is on the Nightmare Throne. There was never a home or family for us to fight for.” We felt a pang of pain deep in our chest, somewhere deeper than even my heart. It had somehow never occurred to me that the cursed spider who started this mess would also grieve for the loss of his home and family. We had torn that from each other years ago, and as punishment, neither of us would ever get it again. Forever each other's prisoner. Suffering from both our own pain and each other's, and helpless to stop either.

“But... even though there might not be anything for us... we can still fight for the others, right? Even if we... become the king of the world... it wouldn't be so bad if we had Erika by our side, right?” We smiled ruefully. “The twin rulers. How does that sound?”

Popsicle let out a long, low whimper, then let out a heavy exhale as his body settled more into our lap.

“They wouldn't allow that, would they?” I murmured. “No, it's meant for us and us alone.”

Why fight for such a lonely existence?

The thought hit us, hard and painful. It didn't sound like the voice of me or the spider, but we felt it internally all the same.

What would even be the point?

This was the thought that encouraged us to look back at the ocean. The waves suddenly didn't seem so treacherous.

“You have to be kidding me,” the spider scoffed. “We've gone through too much together for you to end it like that.”

“I'm alone,” I whispered. “And it's by my own fault... it all is. I killed Erika. I killed WX...”

“They both ended their own lives,” Webber snapped, causing me to flinch. “In case you forgot, you didn't force Erika to come with you. She went herself! The robot chose to take that hit for you. You're going to squander his sacrifice because you're lonely?”

“Webber...” I winced and pressed a hand to my head. He was furious, and rightly so.

And yet, I still stood, and took a step closer to that ledge.

“He died for a cause that was never going to happen. He died so that I could be free, but in the end, it was for nothing. It doesn't matter what happens to my life now. He wouldn't want me to spend the rest of my life ruling the world that killed him.” I shook my head. “Even if it brought him back. Don't you understand?” The laugh that came from my chest was far from a happy one. “No matter who I surround myself with. Even if my family loved me again, if I brought my sister back, if I erased all my mistakes, I could never be happy. You took that away from me.” My voice broke as it rose. “Do you remember what happened when I tried to go home? They stoned me! My friends, my neighbors, my family. I saw my parents that day, Webber! I saw them, and they saw me, and they didn't recognize me. They hated me! They tried to kill me! They- they blamed me for killing their children-!” I let out another incredulous chuckle as it sunk in, as I remembered everything about that awful night. “They didn't recognize me,” I repeated, staring morosely at the ocean. “I thought they would recognize me.”

They don't even miss you.

“I bet they don't even miss me,” I echoed.

Another step. Dangerously close now.

Teeth met my lame hand, struggling to drag me away from the edge. Popsicle whined loudly as he tried to pull me away.

A wave of anger washed over me, likely spawned from the pain of his teeth in my bad hand, and I tore myself away from him. His grip was not as strong as I thought it was, and as soon as he released me I had to take several steps back to balance myself.

First step, ground.

Second step, ground.

Third step, air.

My heart jumped into my throat and I lurched forward to make a desperate grab for the edge as the rest of my body fell over. My claws met rock and scrabbled desperately for a purchase. The lower half of my body slammed into the cliff face, effectively winding me. I could feel my body shaking furiously, both in fear and fatigue. My lack of food and sleep was not doing me any favors.

“No no no no, please no.” I couldn't fall, couldn't die. “Please, please-” I planted my feet against the stone, but I couldn't get a good enough hold to push myself up. Choking back a whimper, I turned my attention to trying to use my upper body strength to pull myself onto solid land. The stone was slick at the edge, and worn smooth by the constant spray of water from below. But I was still holding on, and that had to count for something.

I could see Popsicle pacing back and forth above me, too small to help and too stressed to get help. For once, I couldn't rely on him.

Tears blurred my vision as the truth hit me- the only reliable hold was the one I was grasping now, and pulling myself up was impossible from it.

I had to calm down. I had survived a fall from this very cliff before in the middle of winter. I could survive this. I had to. For Erika, still alive and well even if she was a full spider. For Wilson and Winona, who would surely be waiting for me back at camp. For WX, and the sacrifice that he made so that I could live.

My claws finally gave, and nothing was able to stop me from plummeting from the cliff and straight into the ocean.]]
